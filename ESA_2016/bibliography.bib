abstract = {Evaluates Sale's (1982) suggestion that competitive exclusion was less likely in lottery competitive systems than in those having other mechanisms of competition. An analytical lottery model was developed and used to show that the presence of totally intraspecific competition in the larval stages was responsible for the coexistence of the species in the model. This assumption could allow coexistence for any possible mechanism of adult competition. A model incorporating the more likely assumption of equal inter- and intraspecific laral competition allows at most 2 species to coexist in a constant-environment lottery model. Although some types of environmental variability promote coexistence in the lottery model, analogous types of variability promote coexistence in nonlottery models. Available evidence for territorial coral reef fish most strongly supports an explanation of coexistence based on resource partitioning over other possible explanations.-from Author},

abstract = {We analyze simple models of predator-prey systems in which there is adaptive change in a trait of the prey that determines the rate at which it is captured by searching predators. Two models of adaptive change are explored: (1) change within a single reproducing prey population that has genetic variation for vulnerability to capture by the predator; and (2) direct competition between two independently reproducing prey populations that differ in their vulnerability. When an individual predator's consumption increases at a decreasing rate with prey availability, prey adaptation via either of these mechanisms may produce sustained cycles in both species' population densities and in the prey's mean trait value. Sufficiently rapid adaptive change (e.g., behavioral adaptation or evolution of traits with a large additive genetic variance), or sufficiently low predator birth and death rates will produce sustained cycles or chaos, even when the predator-prey dynamics with fixed prey capture rates would have been stable. Adaptive dynamics can also stabilize a system that would exhibit limit cycles if traits were fixed at their equilibrium values. When evolution fails to stabilize inherently unstable population interactions, selection decreases the prey's escape ability, which further destabilizes population dynamics. When the predator has a linear functional response, evolution of prey vulnerability always promotes stability. The relevance of these results to observed predator-prey cycles is discussed},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the adaptive responses to competition (both character displacement and niche shift) in a two consumer-two resource model. The model includes density dependence that is unrelated to the resources that are explicit in the model. This could be due to another resource dimension, parasites, or interference competition. Competitors adapt by changing their relative consumption rate constants on the two resource types. This model can result in mutually divergent, parallel, or mutually convergent displacement of competitors. Parallel displacement may entail net divergence, net convergence, or no net change. Parallel change with net convergence is most likely when the competitors have similar constraints on the possible values of consumption rate constants, unequal allopatric abundances, and significant intraspecific density dependence. Numerical calculations of displacements are presented for several models and the effect of a number of different possible alterations of the model are discussed. The evolution of resource handling and processing efficiency, and displacement in the presence of additional selective pressures on the character are considered in detail. The results have implications for questions about maximization of population size, the relationship of character displacement and the competition coefficient, and "null" models in the study of competition. Differences between this and previous theoretical works are discussed. It is argued that conditions allowing parallel or convergent displacement are not biologically unlikely, and possible examples are discussed. Data on resource partitioning seem to be more consistent with the results reached here than with previous theory.},

abstract = {This article discusses how the presence of dynamic change in traits affecting inter- specific interactions changes the ways in which interactions between species are distinguished, classified, and measured. The prevalence of models lacking any trait dynamics has led to meth- ods of identifying and measuring indirect effects that are not valid when phenotypically or evolutionarily plastic traits affect interspecific interactions. When traits are dynamic, the number of links in a dynamic model can no longer be used to distinguish direct and indirect effects, and classifying interactions by a single sign denoting effect on equilibrium density becomes problematic. The presence of trait dynamics also changes the interpretation of manipulative experiments that have been used to measure indirect effects. Because both traits and population densities can transmit indirect effects, a given ordered series of species will often transmit several indirect effects, which may have opposite signs. Because some traits can change very rapidly, dynamic equations describing population growth rates may often include the densities of species that interact indirectly with the given species. Some of the conceptual problems in comparing magnitudes of direct and indirect effects are illustrated by simple models of a three- species food chain. Different methods of measuring effect magnitudes can give different condi- tions for when direct effects are larger than indirect effects. Other terminology related to indirect effects, including interaction modification and higher-order interaction, is critically discussed. Given the present paucity of information about trait dynamics, it may be premature to attempt to compare magnitudes of direct and indirect effect.},

abstract = {Simple mathematical models are used to study the interaction between two prey species that share common resources and a common predator In contrast to several previous analyses, this one concentrates on systems that may exhibit cyclic or chaotic dynamics due to the predator's saturating functional response. Under very general conditions, sustained fluctuations make coexistence of prey species more difficult than in comparable systems that are stable. In the model analyzed in greatest detail, there: is a limiting similarity in prey vulnerabilities in cycling systems, although such a limit does not exist in similar stable systems. The responses of mean population densities to model parameters often differ qualitatively between stable and unstable systems. In stable systems with two prey species, enrichment always increases the density of the prey that is poorer at resource exploitation and better at predator avoidance, while decreasing the density of the: other prey. In contrast, in some unstable systems, enrichment increases the densities of both prey, and in others it increases the better exploiter at the expense of the better predator avoider. Enrichment increases the amplitude of population cycles; for predators with saturating functional responses, larger cycles tend to favor the mure vulnerable species. The qualitative results of the analysis are robust to many different changes in the form of the model.},

abstract = {This study investigates the effect of the functional response of resource consumers on the relationship between resource overlap and competition for some two-consumer, two-resource models. Two measures of competition are examined: $\alpha$, the competition coefficient, and $\beta$, an index of the ease of invasion by the second consumer species when the first is at its carrying capacity. A comparison of systems with linear (type-1) and decelerating (type-2) functional responses shows that: (1) Competition coefficients are functions of the population densities of consumers or resources in systems with type-2 responses. (2) Competition coefficients may differ substantially in magnitude between systems with type-1 and type-2 functional responses. (3) The relative handling time of different resources is important in determining the relationship between overlap and competition. Positive correlations between capture rates (per unit resource) and handling times cause the system with type-2 functional responses to exhibit a higher level of competition for a given level of overlap than for the case of negative correlation. (4) If the functional response is type-2 it may be possible to obtain a priority effect in which either consumer species can exclude the other. (5) Invasion may be easier in a system with type-1 functional responses than in a similar system with type-2 functional responses, even when competition coefficients are larger in the former. Accelerating functional responses also affect the relationship between overlap and competition, but realistic models of such responses are likely to be very complex. Several currently accepted ideas in competition theory depend upon the assumption of a linear functional response, and are unlikely to be generally valid. },

abstract = {The phenomenon of a population increasing in response to an increase in its per-capita mortality rate has recently been termed the ?hydra effect?. This article reviews and unifies previous work on this phenomenon. Some discrete models of density-dependent growth were shown to exhibit hydra effects in 1954, but the topic was then ignored for decades. Here the history of research on the hydra effect is reviewed, and the key factors producing it are explored. Mortality that precedes overcompensatory density dependence always has the potential to produce hydra effects. Even when mortality follows density dependence, hydra effects may occur in unstable systems due to changes in the amplitude and⁄ or form of population cycles. An increase in resource productivity due to lower consumption rates following increased consumer mortality can also produce a hydra effect. Lower consumption can come about as the result of increased satiation of the consumers or changes in behaviour of either consumer or resource species that reduce the mean attack rate. Changes in species composition of a resource community may also decrease the average attack rate. Population structure can promote hydra effects by allowing separation of the timing of density dependence and mortality, although stage-specific density dependence usually decreases hydra effects.},

Monotonically increas- ing curves have recently been dismissed on both empirical and theoretical grounds, while unimodal ("hump-shaped") curves have been supported. Unimodal curves have been attributed to increased competitive exclusion, usually as the result of decreased heterogeneity in limiting resources at high productivities. This article argues that: (1) there are many viable mechanisms that can produce monotonic curves in the presence of competition; (2) there is little empirical support for any of the major variants of the hypothesis that productivity decreases heterogeneity, which increases competitive exclusion; and (3) there are alternative reasons for unimodal curves, some or all of which are consistent with previously observed productivity-diversity relationships. Additional theoretical and empirical work is required to understand what relationships follow from different mechanisms of competition, and what relationships are most frequently observed under different observational protocols.},

abstract = {This article investigates some simple models of the evolutionary interaction between two prey species that share a common resource and a common predator. Each prey species is characterized by a trait that determines both the rate of resource capture and vulnerability to a predator. In a simple model of a three-species food chain, such traits usually increase in response to an imposed reduction in resource density. When the per capita growth rates of each of two prey species depend linearly on resource density, such traits will change in opposite directions when the two prey come into sympatry. In addition, the ratio of the effect of the predator on prey fitness to the effect of the resource on prey fitness will diverge from the corresponding ratio in a second prey species when those species coexist in sympatry. These simple predictions need not hold under several alternative assumptions, which may be more common in biological systems. Parallel changes in sympatry may occur if the relationship between resource consumption and prey growth is nonlinear, if the prey species have partial overlap in the set of resources used or in the set of predators that consume them, or if prey experience direct intraspecific competition. The responses to a second prey can also differ significantly from those predicted by the simplest model if separate traits affect vulnerability to predators and resource acquisition rate. It is important to determine whether examples of character displacement previously interpreted as responses to competition for resources might also reflect responses to altered predation risks in sympatry.},

Recently, much work has been devoted to comparing two idealized forms of the functional response: prey dependent and ratio dependent. Although we agree that predator abundance often affects the consumption rate of individual predators, this phenomenon requires more attention.

The results are compared to analogous findings for systems that reach a stable equilibrium point. It is common for removal of one prey from a cycling system to result in a decrease in the mean density of the remaining prey species, contrary to the usual logic of apparent competition. Even when apparent competition between prey exists, its magnitude is usually reduced by population cycles. This effect occurs when the predator has a concave-down relationship between prey abundance and its own per capita growth rate. Such relationships can occur because of a saturating functional or numerical response. We investigate how prey density dependence and the shape of the predator's functional and numerical responses affect the sign and magnitude of this indirect interaction between prey species. There may also be (+, -) interactions between prey that differ significantly in their susceptibility to the common predator.},

abstract = {Two prey populations that share a common predator can interact indirectly by causing changes in the predator's foraging behaviour. Previous work suggests that adaptive choice of prey by the predator usually has two related consequences: (i) the predation rate on a particular prey species increases with the relative and/or absolute abundance of that prey; and (ii) increases in either prey population produce a short-term increase in the fitness of the other prey (short-term indirect mutualism between prey). This paper investigates how these two consequences are changed if the prey exhibit adaptive anti-predator behaviour. In this case, the predation rate on a particular prey often decreases as the prey's density increases. The predator then usually exhibits negative switching between prey. However, the presence of adaptive antipredator behaviour does not change the short-term mutualism between prey. In this case, as a prey becomes less common, it achieves a larger growth rate by reducing its anti-predator effort. These results imply that observations of the relationship between prey density and predation rate cannot be used to infer the nature of the behavioural indirect effect between prey that share a predator.},

abstract = {A classic problem in population and evolutionary biology is to understand how a population optimizes its fitness in fluctuating environments. A population might enhance its fitness by allowing individual cells to stochastically transition among multiple phenotypes, thus ensuring that some cells are always prepared for an unforeseen environmental fluctuation. Here we experimentally explore how switching affects population growth by using the galactose utilization network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We engineered a strain that randomly transitions between two phenotypes as a result of stochastic gene expression. Each phenotype was designed to confer a growth advantage over the other phenotype in a certain environment. When we compared the growth of two populations with different switching rates, we found that fast-switching populations outgrow slow switchers when the environment fluctuates rapidly, whereas slow-switching phenotypes outgrow fast switchers when the environment changes rarely. These results suggest that cells may tune inter-phenotype switching rates to the frequency of environmental changes.},

abstract = {Plant functional traits vary both along environmental gradients and among species occupying similar conditions, creating a challenge for the synthesis of functional and community ecology. We present a trait-based approach that provides an additive decomposition of species' trait values into alpha and beta components: beta values refer to a species' position along a gradient defined by community-level mean trait values; alpha values are the difference between a species' trait values and the mean of co-occurring taxa. In woody plant communities of coastal California, beta trait values for specific leaf area, leaf size, wood density and maximum height all covary strongly, reflecting species distributions across a gradient of soil moisture availability. Alpha values, on the other hand, are generally not significantly correlated, suggesting several independent axes of differentiation within communities. This trait-based framework provides a novel approach to integrate functional ecology and gradient analysis with community ecology and coexistence theory.},

abstract = {Background: As modern humans, we spend the majority of our time in indoor environments. Consequently, environmental exposure to microorganisms has important implications for human health, and a better understanding of the ecological drivers and processes that impact indoor microbial assemblages will be key for expanding our knowledge of the built environment. In the present investigation, we combined recent studies examining the microbiota of the built environment in order to identify unifying community patterns and the relative importance of indoor environmental factors. Ultimately, the present meta-analysis focused on studies of bacteria and archaea due to the limited number of high-throughput fungal studies from the indoor environment.We combined 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene datasets from 16 surveys of indoor environments conducted worldwide, additionally including 7 other studies representing putative environmental sources ofmicrobial taxa (outdoor air, soil, and the human body). Results: Combined analysis of subsets of studies that shared specific experimental protocols or indoor habitats revealed community patterns indicative of consistent source environments and environmental filtering. Additionally, we were able to identify several consistent sources for indoor microorganisms, particularly outdoor air and skin, mirroring what has been shown in individual studies. Technical variation across studies had a strong effect on comparisons of microbial community assemblages, with differences in experimental protocols limiting our ability to extensively explore the importance of, for example, sampling locality, building function and use, or environmental substrate in structuring indoor microbial communities. Conclusions: We present a snapshot of an important scientific field in its early stages, where studies have tended to focus on heavy sampling in a few geographic areas. From the practical perspective, this endeavor reinforces the importance of negative “kit” controls in microbiome studies. From the perspective of understanding mechanistic processes in the built environment, this meta-analysis confirms that broad factors, such as geography and building type, structure indoor microbes. However, this exercise suggests that individual studies with common sampling techniques may be more appropriate to explore the relative importance of subtle indoor environmental factors on the indoor microbiome.},

abstract = {The indoor microbiome is a complex system that is thought to depend on dispersal from the outdoor biome and the occupants' microbiome combined with selective pressures imposed by the occupants' behaviors and the building itself. We set out to determine the pattern of fungal diversity and composition in indoor air on a local scale and to identify processes behind that pattern. We surveyed airborne fungal assemblages within 1-month time periods at two seasons, with high replication, indoors and outdoors, within and across standardized residences at a university housing facility. Fungal assemblages indoors were diverse and strongly determined by dispersal from outdoors, and no fungal taxa were found as indicators of indoor air. There was a seasonal effect on the fungi found in both indoor and outdoor air, and quantitatively more fungal biomass was detected outdoors than indoors. A strong signal of isolation by distance existed in both outdoor and indoor airborne fungal assemblages, despite the small geographic scale in which this study was undertaken ({\textless}500 m). Moreover, room and occupant behavior had no detectable effect on the fungi found in indoor air. These results show that at the local level, outdoor air fungi dominate the patterning of indoor air. More broadly, they provide additional support for the growing evidence that dispersal limitation, even on small geographic scales, is a key process in structuring the often-observed distance-decay biogeographic pattern in microbial communities.},

abstract = {How expected increases in climate variability will affect species diversity depends on the role of such variability in regulating the coexistence of competing species. Despite theory linking temporal environmental fluctuations with the maintenance of diversity, the importance of climate variability for stabilizing coexistence remains unknown because of a lack of appropriate long-term observations. Here, we analyze three decades of demographic data from a Kansas prairie to demonstrate that interannual climate variability promotes the coexistence of three common grass species. Specifically, we show that (i) the dynamics of the three species satisfy all requirements of "storage effect" theory based on recruitment variability with overlapping generations, (ii) climate variables are correlated with interannual variation in species performance, and (iii) temporal variability increases low-density growth rates, buffering these species against competitive exclusion. Given that environmental fluctuations are ubiquitous in natural systems, our results suggest that coexistence based on the storage effect may be underappreciated and could provide an important alternative to recent neutral theories of diversity. Field evidence for positive effects of variability on coexistence also emphasizes the need to consider changes in both climate means and variances when forecasting the effects of global change on species diversity.},

abstract = {Recent functional trait studies have shown that trait differences may favour certain species (environmental filtering) while simultaneously preventing competitive exclusion (niche partitioning). However, phenomenological trait-dispersion analyses do not identify the mechanisms that generate niche partitioning, preventing trait-based prediction of future changes in biodiversity. We argue that such predictions require linking functional traits with recognised coexistence mechanisms involving spatial or temporal environmental heterogeneity, resource partitioning and natural enemies. We first demonstrate the limitations of phenomenological approaches using simulations, and then (1) propose trait-based tests of coexistence, (2) generate hypotheses about which plant functional traits are likely to interact with particular mechanisms and (3) review the literature for evidence for these hypotheses. Theory and data suggest that all four classes of coexistence mechanisms could act on functional trait variation, but some mechanisms will be stronger and more widespread than others. The highest priority for future research is studies of interactions between environmental heterogeneity and trait variation that measure environmental variables at within-community scales and quantify species' responses to the environment in the absence of competition. Evidence that similar trait-based coexistence mechanisms operate in many ecosystems would simplify biodiversity forecasting and represent a rare victory for generality over contingency in community ecology.},

Here, we use classical coexistence theory to reframe the debate in terms of stabilizing mechanisms (niches) and fitness equivalence (neutrality). The neutral model is a special case where stabilizing mechanisms are absent and species have equivalent fitness. Instead of asking whether niches or neutral processes structure communities, we advocate determining the degree to which observed diversity reflects strong stabilizing mechanisms overcoming large fitness differences or weak stabilization operating on species of similar fitness. To answer this question, we propose combining data on per capita growth rates with models to: (i) quantify the strength of stabilizing processes; (ii) quantify fitness inequality and compare it with stabilization; and (iii) manipulate frequency dependence in growth to test the consequences of stabilization and fitness equivalence for coexistence.},

In keeping with bet hedging theory, we found that many viable seeds would not germinate in response to any combination of treatments (germination usually {\textless}50{\%}). In keeping with the storage effect model, we found that these coexisting species differed in their germination response to our experimental manipulations and also differed in how the experimental variables interact. Field germination data from a long-term project on population and community dynamics of this guild show that germination fractions are similar between field and growth chamber and that species that tend to germinate under early season conditions in the growth chamber also tend to do so under unmanipulated field conditions. Some species are nondormant during the summer and only acquire dormancy at the onset of the autumn germination season, while others appear to have either innate or conditional dormancy until the onset of the germination season.},

Both theoretically and empirically it is found for whole plants as well as for different tissues that nitrogen concentrations increase slower than phospho- rus concentrations. A lack of data prevents the establishment of relations be- tween nitrogen and other elements. Optimal element ratios where elements are simultaneously limiting growth can be established. There is a consider- able variability around these optimal ratios in observed values. Conclusions about the ecological significance of stoichiometric relations based on these observations may therefore be biased. The significance of this variability remains to be established.},

The main role of QS is regulation of production of virulence factors in bacteria. Bacterial pathogenicity is often manifested by the expression of various cell-associated and secreted virulence factors, such as exoenzymes, toxins and biofilm. In bacteria, the expression of virulence factors is controlled coordinately by the global regulatory QS systems, which includes the AI-1/LuxIR-, AI-2/LuxS-, AI-3/QsC-, AIP/Agr-based systems.

abstract = {Habitat transformation is one of the leading drivers of biodiversity loss. The ecological effects of this trans- formation have mainly been addressed at the demographic level, for example, finding extinction thresholds. However, interpopulation genetic variability and the subsequent potential for adaptation can be eroded before effects are noticed on species abundances. To what degree this is the case has been difficult to eval- uate, partly because of the lack of both spatially extended genetic data and an appropriate framework to map and analyse such data. Here, we extend recent work on the analysis of networks of spatial genetic var- iation to address the robustness of these networks in the face of perturbations. We illustrate the potential of this framework using the case study of an amphibian metapopulation. Our results show that while the disappearance of some spatial sites barely changes the modular structure of the genetic network, other sites have a much stronger effect. Interestingly, these consequences can not be anticipated using topological, sta- tic measures. Mapping these networks of spatial genetic variation will allow identifying significant evolution- ary units and how they vanish, merge and reorganise following perturbations. Keywords},

If, as emerging evidence shows, rapid evolutionary change affects ecosystem functioning and stability, current rapid environmental change and its evolutionary effects might have significant implications for ecological and human wellbeing on a relatively short time scale. Humans are major selective agents with potential for unprecedented evolutionary consequences for Earth's ecosystems, especially as cities expand rapidly. In this review, I identify emerging hypotheses on how urbanization drives eco-evolutionary dynamics. Studying how human-driven micro-evolutionary changes interact with ecological processes offers us the chance to advance our understanding of eco-evolutionary feedbacks and will provide new insights for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem function over the long term.},

abstract = {Urban ecological systems are characterized by complex interactions among social, economic, institutional, and environmental variables. These interactions generate complex human-domi- nated landscapes, which significantly influence the functioning of local and global earth ecosys- tems and the services they provide to humans and other life on earth. Urban development frag- ments, isolates,anddegrades natural habitats; simplifies andhomogenizes species composition; disrupts hydrological systems; and modifies energy flow and nutrient cycling. Urban areas also appropriate a large share of earth's carrying capacity from other regions in terms of resource input and waste sinks. Change in ecological conditions that result from human actions in urban areas ultimately affecthumanhealthandwell-being. Inthis article, the author reviewsthe empir- ical evidence on the effects that patterns of urban development have on ecosystem function. Urbandevelopment affects the spatial heterogeneity of the landscape (i.e., pattern of variation in land cover) and spread of disturbance (i.e., invasive species). The author proposes that alterna- tive urban patterns generate differential ecological effects. The review reveals that the interac- tions between urban development patterns and ecosystem dynamics are still poorly understood. The author draws on an empirical study of the Puget Sound metropolitan region currently devel- oped at the University ofWashington to propose directions for future empirical research that can inform strategies to minimize urban impacts on ecosystems.},

Empirical evidence and theory suggest that traits there can evolve rapidly enough to interact with ecological dynamics, potentially giving rise to accelerating spread. Nevertheless, which of several evolutionary mechanisms drive this interaction between evolution and spread remains an open question. We propose an integrated theoretical framework for partitioning the contributions of different evolutionary mechanisms to accelerating spread, and we apply this model to invasive cane toads in northern Australia. In doing so, we identify a previously unrecognised evolutionary process that involves an interaction between life-history and dispersal evolution during range shift. In roughly equal parts, life-history evolution, dispersal evolution and their interaction led to a doubling of distance spread by cane toads in our model, highlighting the potential importance of multiple evolutionary processes in the dynamics of range expansion.},

Although the subject matter is relatively advanced, this book has been written with the express goal of being accessible to students with only modest backgrounds in ecology and aquatic sciences. The First Edition was widely praised for its readability, and that emphasis is retained. The second edition opens with a new introductory chapter that sets the stage for what follows. The treatment of geomorphology and hydrology are greatly expanded from the first edition, and have been split into two, more substantial chapters. Basal energy resources, trophic roles and food web interactions are retained but thoroughly updated, particularly to include recent advances in microbial ecology and the synergies between producers and decomposers. The discussion of species interactions has been re-organized so that modern topics receive more emphasis, including trophic cascades, subsidies and food web structure. Chapters on organic matter dynamics and nutrient cycling have been substantially re-written to reflect the enormous growth in knowledge of stream metabolism and nutrient processes, the core of ecosystem functioning. The closing chapter on human impacts summarizes the status of river ecosystems and principal threats, and new material that describes advances in river management including the science of environmental flows, the successes and failures of river restoration, and the potential for ecosystem-based catchment management.},

abstract = {When new habitats are created, community assembly may follow independent trajectories, since the relative importance of dispersal limitation, priority effects, species interactions, and environmental gradients can vary as assembly proceeds. Unfortunately, tracking community colonization and composition across decades is challenging. We compiled a multiyear community composition data set and reconstructed past communities with remains from sediment cores to investigate cladoceran assembly dynamics in six older (1920s) and two more recently formed (1950s) lakes. We found that current communities cluster along a gradient of thermal stratification that is known to influence predation intensity. Assembling communities showed evidence for a greater influence of species sorting and a reduced influence of spatial structure since the first colonizations. However, lake community trajectories varied considerably, reflecting different colonization sequences among lakes. In the older lakes, small-bodied cladocerans often arrived much earlier than large-bodied cladocerans, while the two younger lakes were colonized much more rapidly, and one was quickly dominated by a large-bodied species. Thus, by combining contemporary community data with paleoecological records, we show that assembly history influences natural community structure for decades while patterns of ecological sorting develop.},

abstract = {For many decades, ecologists have asked what prevents herbivores from consuming most of the plant biomass in terrestrial ecosystems, or "Why is the world green?" Here I ask the analogous question for detritivores: what prevents them from degrading most of the organic material in soils, or "Why is the ground brown?" For fresh plant detritus, constraints on decomposition closely parallel constraints on herbivory: both herbivore and decomposer populations may be controlled by plant tissue chemistry from the bottom up and predators from the top down. However, the majority of soil carbon is not plant litter but carbon that has been consumed by detritivores and reprocessed into humic compounds with complex and random chemical structures. This carbon persists mainly because the chemical properties of humic compounds and interactions with soil minerals constrain decomposition by extracellular enzymes in soil. Other constraints on decomposers, such as nutrient limitation of enzyme production and competition with opportunistic microbes, also contribute to brown ground. Ultimately, the oldest soil carbon persists via transformation into complex molecules that are impervious to enzymatic attack and effectively decoupled from processing by the soil food web.},

Because the factors regulating enzyme production are poorly understood, I used a simulation model to examine how competition, nutrient availability and spatial structure affect microbial growth and enzyme synthesis. In simulations where enzyme-producing microbes competed with cheaters (who do not synthesize enzymes but take-up product), higher enzyme costs favoured cheaters, while lower rates of enzyme diffusion favoured producers. Cheaters and producers coexisted in highly organized spatial patterns at intermediate enzyme costs and diffusion rates. Simulations with varying nutrient inputs showed that nitrogen supply can limit carbon mineralization, microbial growth and enzyme production because of the nitrogen-demanding stoichiometry of enzymes (C†:†N†=†c. 3.5†:†1). These results suggest that competition from cheaters, slow diffusion and nitrogen limitation may constrain microbial foraging and the enzymatic decomposition of complex compounds in natural environments.},

abstract = {Rates of ecosystem processes such as decomposition are likely to change as a result of human impacts on the environment. In southern California, climate change and nitrogen (N) deposition in particular may alter biological communities and ecosystem processes. These drivers may affect decomposition directly, through changes in abiotic conditions, and indirectly through changes in plant and decomposer communities. To assess indirect effects on litter decomposition, we reciprocally transplanted microbial communities and plant litter among control and treatment plots (either drought or N addition) in a grassland ecosystem. We hypothesized that drought would reduce decomposition rates through moisture limitation of decomposers and reductions in plant litter quality before and during decomposition. In contrast, we predicted that N deposition would stimulate decomposition by relieving N limitation of decomposers and improving plant litter quality. We also hypothesized that adaptive mechanisms would allow microbes to decompose litter more effectively in their native plot and litter environments. Consistent with our first hypothesis, we found that drought treatment reduced litter mass loss from 20.9{\%} to 15.3{\%} after six months. There was a similar decline in mass loss of litter inoculated with microbes transplanted from the drought treatment, suggesting a legacy effect of drought driven by declines in microbial abundance and possible changes in microbial community composition. Bacterial cell densities were up to 86{\%} lower in drought plots and at least 50{\%} lower on litter derived from the drought treatment, whereas fungal hyphal lengths increased by 13–14{\%}in the drought treatment. Nitrogen effects on decomposition rates and microbial abundances were weaker than drought effects, although N addition significantly altered initial plant litter chemistry and litter chemistry during decomposition. However, we did find support for microbial adaptation toNaddition with N-derived microbes facilitating greater mass loss inN plots than in control plots. Our results show that environmental changes can affect rates of ecosystem processes directly through abiotic changes and indirectly through microbial abundances and communities. Therefore models of ecosystem response to global change may need to represent microbial biomass and community composition to make accurate predictions.},

abstract = {Although it is generally accepted that plant community composition is key for predicting rates of ecosystem processes in the face of global change, microbial community composition is often ignored in ecosystem modeling. To address this issue, we review recent experiments and assess whether microbial community composition is resistant, resilient, or functionally redundant in response to four different disturbances. We find that the composition of most microbial groups is sensitive and not immediately resilient to disturbance, regardless of taxonomic breadth of the group or the type of disturbance. Other studies demonstrate that changes in composition are often associated with changes in ecosystem process rates. Thus, changes in microbial communities due to disturbance may directly affect ecosystem processes. Based on these relationships, we propose a simple framework to incorporate microbial community composition into ecosystem process models. We conclude that this effort would benefit from more empirical data on the links among microbial phylogeny, physiological traits, and disturbance responses. These relationships will determine how readily microbial community composition can be used to predict the responses of ecosystem processes to global change.},

abstract = {Most ecosystem models predict that climate warming will stimulate microbial decomposition of soil carbon, producing a positive feedback to rising global temperatures(1,2). Although field experiments document an initial increase in the loss of CO2 from soils in response to warming, in line with these predictions, the carbon dioxide loss from soils tends to decline to control levels within a few years(3-5). This attenuation response could result from changes in microbial physiological properties with increasing temperature, such as a decline in the fraction of assimilated carbon that is allocated to growth, termed carbon-use efficiency(6). Here we explore these mechanisms using a microbial-enzyme model to simulate the responses of soil carbon to warming by 5 degrees C. We find that declines in microbial biomass and degradative enzymes can explain the observed attenuation of soil-carbon emissions in response to warming. Specifically, reduced carbon-use efficiency limits the biomass of microbial decomposers and mitigates the loss of soil carbon. However, microbial adaptation or a change in microbial communities could lead to an upward adjustment of the efficiency of carbon use, counteracting the decline in microbial biomass and accelerating soil-carbon loss. We conclude that the soil-carbon response to climate warming depends on the efficiency of soil microbes in using carbon.},

abstract = {Dispersal among ecological communities is usually assumed to be random in direction, or to vary in distance or frequency among species. However, a variety of natural systems and types of organisms may experience dispersal that is biased by directional currents or by gravity on hillslopes. We developed a general model for competing species in metacommunities to evaluate the role of directionally biased dispersal on species diversity, abundance, and traits. In parallel, we tested the role of directionally biased dispersal on communities in a microcosm experiment with protists and rotifers. Both the model and experiment independently demonstrated that diversity in local communities was reduced by directionally biased dispersal, especially dispersal that was biased away from disturbed patches. Abundance of species (and composition) in local communities was a product of disturbance intensity but not dispersal directionality. High disturbance selected for species with high intrinsic growth rates and low competitive abilities. Overall, our conclusions about the key role of dispersal directionality in (meta)communities seem robust and general, since they were supported both by the model, which was set in a general framework and not parameterized to fit to a specific system, and by a specific experimental test with microcosms.},

abstract = {Understanding the processes that maintain diversity has been the focus of extensive study, yet there is much that has not been integrated into a cohesive framework. First, there is a separation of perspective. Ecological and evolutionary approaches to diversity have progessed in largely parallel directions. Second, there is a separation of emphasis. In both ecology and population genetics, classical theories favour local explanations with emphasis on population dynamics and selection within populations, while contemporary theories favour spatial explanations, with emphasis on population structure and interactions among populations. What is lacking is a comparative approach that evaluates the relative importance of local and spatial processes in maintaining genetic and ecological diversity. I present a framework for diversity maintenance that emphasizes the comparative approach. I use a well-known but little-used mathematical approach, the perturbation theorem for dynamical systems, to identify key points of contact between ecological and population genetic theories of coexistence. These connections provide for a synthesis of several important concepts: population structure (source-sink versus extinction-colonization), spatial heterogeneity (intrinsic versus extrinsic) in fitness and competitive ability, and temporal scales over which local and spatial processes influence diversity. This framework ties together a large and diverse body of theory and data from ecology and population genetics. It yields comparative predictions that can serve as guidelines in biodiversity management. (C) 2000 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract = {The prevalence of intraguild predation (IGP) in productive environments has long puzzled ecologists. Theory predicts the exclusion of intraguild prey from such environments, but data consistently defy this expectation. This suggests that coexistence mechanisms at high resource productivity may differ from those at lower productivity. Here I present a mathematical model that investigates multiple coexistence mechanisms. I incorporate two biological features widely observed in IGP communities: intraspecific interference via cannibalism or superparasitism, and temporal refuges arising from differential sensitivities to abiotic variation. I develop predictions based on three aspects of the IG prey-IG predator interaction: mutual invasibility, transient dynamics, and long-term abundances. These predictions specify the conditions under which coexistence mechanisms reinforce vs. deter one another: when a competition-IGP trade-off allows coexistence at intermediate productivity a temporal refuge for the intraguild prey always allows coexistence at high productivity, but intraspecific interference does so only at a net fitness cost to the intraguild predator. Intraspecific interference that benefits the intraguild predator not only reduces tradeoff-mediated coexistence at intermediate productivity, but also undermines the refuge's coexistence-enhancing effect at high productivity. Different mechanism combinations yield characteristic signatures in time series data during transient dynamics. By judicious measurement of parameters and examining time series for critical signatures, one can elucidate the mechanisms that allow IGP to prevail in resource-rich environments.},

abstract = {Although there is a large body of theory on spatial competitive coexistence, very little of it involves comparative analyses of alternative mechanisms. We thus have limited knowledge of the conditions under which multiple spatial mechanisms can operate or of emergent properties arising from interactions between mechanisms. Here we present a mathematical framework that allows for comparative analysis of spatial coexistence mechanisms. The basis for comparison is mechanisms operating in spatially homogeneous competitive environments (e.g., life-history trade-offs) versus mechanisms operating in spatially heterogeneous competitive environments (e.g., source-sink dynamics). Our comparative approach leads to several new insights about spatial coexistence. First, we show that spatial variation in the expression of a life-history trade-off leads to a unique regional pattern that cannot be predicted by considering trade-offs or source-sink dynamics alone. This result represents an instance where spatial heterogeneity constrains rather than promotes coexistence, and it illustrates the kind of counterintuitive emergent properties that arise due to interactions between different classes of mechanisms. Second, we clarify the role of dispersal mortality in spatial coexistence. Previous studies have shown that coexistence can be constrained or facilitated by dispersal mortality. Our broader analysis distinguishes situations where dispersal mortality is not necessary for coexistence from those where such mortality is essential for coexistence because it preserves spatial variation in the strength of competition. These results form the basis for two important future directions: evolution of life-history traits in spatially heterogeneous environments and elucidation of the cause and effect relationship(s) between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {Patch occupancy theory predicts that a trade-off between competition and dispersal should lead to regional coexistence of competing species. Empirical investigations, however, find local coexistence of superior and inferior competitors, an outcome that cannot be explained within the patch occupancy framework because of the decoupling of local and spatial dynamics. We develop two-patch metapopulation models that explicitly consider the interaction between competition and dispersal. We show that a dispersal-competition trade-off can lead to local coexistence provided the inferior competitor is superior at colonizing empty patches as well as immigrating among occupied patches. Immigration from patches that the superior competitor cannot colonize rescues the inferior competitor from extinction in patches that both species colonize. Too much immigration, however, can be detrimental to coexistence. When competitive asymmetry between species is high, local coexistence is possible only if the dispersal rate of the inferior competitor occurs below a critical threshold. If competing species have comparable colonization abilities and the environment is otherwise spatially homogeneous, a superior ability to immigrate among occupied patches cannot prevent exclusion of the inferior competitor. If, however, biotic or abiotic factors create spatial heterogeneity in competitive rankings across the landscape, local coexistence can occur even in the absence of a dispersal-competition trade-off. In fact, coexistence requires that the dispersal rate of the overall inferior competitor not exceed a critical threshold. Explicit consideration of how dispersal modifies local competitive interactions shifts the focus from the patch occupancy approach with its emphasis on extinction-colonization dynamics to the realm of source-sink dynamics. The key to coexistence in this framework is spatial variance in fitness. Unlike in the patch occupancy framework, high rates of dispersal can undermine coexistence, and hence diversity, by reducing spatial variance in fitness.},

abstract = {Aim To test whether within-species and among-species patterns of abundance and latitudinal range in marine bacteria resemble those found for macro-organisms, and whether these patterns differ along latitudinal clines. Location Global pelagic marine environments. Methods Taxon-specific sequence abundance and location were retrieved from the open-access V6-rRNA pyrotag sequence data base VAMPS (http://vamps.mbl.edu/), which holds a massive collection of marine bacterial community data sets from the International Census of Marine Microbes sampling effort of global ocean water masses. Data were randomly subsampled to correct for spatial bias and for differences in sampling effort. Results We show that bacterial latitudinal ranges are narrower than expected by chance. When present in both Northern and Southern hemispheres, taxa occupy restricted ranges at similar latitudes on both sides of the equator. A significant and positive relationship exists between sequence abundance and latitudinal range, although this pattern contains a large amount of variance. Abundant taxa in the tropics and in the Northern Hemisphere generally have smaller ranges than those in the Southern Hemisphere. We show that the mean latitudinal range of bacterial taxa increases with latitude, supporting the existence of a Rapoport effect in marine bacterioplankton. Finally, we show that bacterioplankton communities contain a higher proportion of abundant taxa as they approach the poles. Main conclusions Macroecological patterns such as the abundance–range relationship, in general, extend to marine bacteria. However, differences in the shape of these relationships between bacteria and macro-organisms call into question whether the processes and their relative importance in shaping global marine bacteria and macro-organism distributions are the same.},

abstract = {There is a need to identify measurable characteristics of stream channel morphology that vary predictably throughout stream networks and that influence patterns of hyporheic exchange flow in mountain streams. In this paper we characterize stream longitudinal profiles according to channel unit spacing and the concavity of the water surface profile. We demonstrate that: (1) the spacing between zones of upwelling and downwelling in the beds of mountain streams is closely related to channel unit spacing; (2) the magnitude of the vertical hydraulic gradients (VHGs) driving hyporheic exchange flow increase with increasing water surface concavity, measured at specific points along the longitudinal profile; (3) channel unit spacing and water surface concavity are useful metrics for predicting how patterns in hyporheic exchange vary amongst headwater and mid-order streams. We use regression models to describe changes in channel unit spacing and concavity in longitudinal profiles for 12 randomly selected stream reaches spanning 62 km2 in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in Oregon. Channel unit spacing increased significantly, whereas average water surface concavity (AWSC) decreased significantly with increasing basin area. Piezometer transects installed longitudinally in a subset of stream reaches were used to measure VHG in the hyporheic zone, and to determine the location of upwelling and downwelling zones. Predictions for median pool length and median distance between steps in piezometer reaches bracketed the median distance separating zones of upwelling in the stream bed. VHG in individual piezometers increased with increasing water surface concavity at individual points in the longitudinal profile along piezometer transects. Absolute values of VHG, averaged throughout piezometer transects, increased with increasing AWSC, indicating increased potential for hyporheic exchange flow. These findings suggest that average hyporheic flow path lengths increase—and the potential for hyporheic exchange flow in stream reaches decreases—along the continuum from headwater to mid-order mountain streams.},

We describe an instability driven by directional dispersal in a spatially explicit consumer–producer model where spatial patterns emerge in the absence of external environmental variation. Dispersal of the consumer has both undirected and directed components that are functions of producer biomass. We demonstrate that directional dispersal is required for the instability, while undirected diffusive dispersal sets a lower bound to the spatial scale of emerging patterns. Furthermore, instability requires indirect feedbacks affecting consumer per capita dispersal rates, and not activator–inhibitor dynamics affecting production and mortality as is described in previous theory. This novel and less-restrictive mechanism for generating spatial patterns can arise over realistic parameter values, which we explore using an empirically inspired model and data on stream macroinvertebrates.},

This method is an extension of an existing method for partialling out the spatial component of environmental variation, using canonical analysis. Our proposed method extends this approach by including temporal variables in the analysis. Thus, the partitioning of variation for a data matrix of species'abundances or biomass can include, by our methodology, the following components: (1) pure environmental, (2) pure spatial, (3) pure temporal, (4) pure spatial component of environmental, (5) pure temporal component of environmental, (6) pure combined spatial/temporal component, (7) combined spatial/temporal component of environmental and (8) unexplained. In addition, permutation testing accompanying the analyses allows tests of significance for the relationship between the different components and the species data. We illustrate the method with a set of survey data of penaeid species (prawns) obtained on the far northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. This extension is a useful tool for multivariate analysis of ecological data from surveys, where space, time and environment commonly overlap and are important influences on observed variation.},

abstract = {Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The teststatistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

Differences in beta diversity among different areas or groups of samples can be tested using this approach. The choice of transformation and dissimilarity measure has important consequences for interpreting results. For kelp holdfast assemblages from New Zealand, variation in species composition was greater in smaller holdfasts, while variation in relative abundances was greater in larger holdasts. Variation in community structure of Norwegian continental shelf macrobenthic fauna increased with increases in environmental heterogeneity, regardless of the measure used.

abstract = {ANOSIM, PERMANOVA, and the Mantel test are all resemblance-based permutation methods widely used in ecology. Here, we report the results of the first simulation study, to our knowledge, specifically designed to examine the effects of heterogeneity of multivariate dispersions on the rejection rates of these tests and on a classical MANOVA test (Pillai's trace). Increasing differences in dispersion among groups were simulated under scenarios of changing sample sizes, correlation structures, error distributions, numbers of variables, and numbers of groups for balanced and unbalanced one-way designs. The power of these tests to detect environmental impacts or natural large-scale biogeographic gradients was also compared empirically under simulations based on parameters derived from real ecological data sets. Overall, ANOSIM and the Mantel test were very sensitive to heterogeneity in dispersions, with ANOSIM generally being more sensitive than the Mantel test. In contrast, PERMANOVA and Pillai's trace were largely unaffected by heterogeneity for balanced designs. PERMANOVA was also unaffected by differences in correlation structure, unlike Pillai's trace. For unbalanced designs, however, all of the tests were (1) too liberal when the smaller group had greater dispersion and (2) overly conservative when the larger group had greater dispersion, especially ANOSIM and the Mantel test. For simulations based on real ecological data sets, PERMANOVA was generally, but not always, more powerful than the others to detect changes in community structure, and the Mantel test was usually more powerful than ANOSIM. Both the error distributions and the resemblance measure affected results concerning power. Differences in the underlying construction of these test statistics result in important differences in the nature of the null hypothesis they are testing, their sensitivity to heterogeneity, and their power to detect important changes in ecological communities. For balanced designs, PERMANOVA and PERMDISP can be used to rigorously identify location vs. dispersion effects, respectively, in the space of the chosen resemblance measure. ANOSIM and the Mantel test can be used as more ‘‘omnibus'' tests, being sensitive to differences in location, dispersion or correlation structure among groups. Unfortunately, none of the tests (PERMANOVA, Mantel, or ANOSIM) behaved reliably for unbalanced designs in the face of heterogeneity.},

abstract = {A study of the wood-associated invertebrates was undertaken in seven streams of the Coast and Cascade Mountains of Oregon. The amount of wood debris was determined in terms of both weight and surface area. Standing crop of wood per unit area decreases with increasing stream order. Invertebrates associated with wood were functionally categorized and their biomass on wood determined. Major xylophagous species were the caddisfly (Heteroplectron californicum), the elmid beetle (Lara avara) and the snail (Oxytrema silicula). Standing crop of these species is greater on wood in the Coast Range than in the Cascades, which is attributed to species composition of available wood debris. The density of L. avara was strongly correlated with the amount of wood available irrespective of stream size within a drainage. The standing crop of invertebrates was about two orders of magnitude greater on leaf debris than on wood. A potential strategy for wood consumption, based on microbial conditioning, is presented. The data are used to develop a general scheme of wood processing by invertebrates in small stream ecosystems. Their impact is similar to that of invertebrates which process leaf litter in terrestrial and aquatic environments when the full decomposition cycle of wood debris is considered.},

The role of detritus in aquatic ecosystems was discussed in two recent symposia(1 , 109).

Thus, with the upsurge interest in this topic, it is timelyt o reviewc ontributions,e specially on the role of macroinvertebrates that feed on detritus, and in so doing affect particle size reduction and eventual mineralization of the material. A central feature of stream ecosystems is the unidirectional flow of the water. In addition to shaping the physical habitat, the current influences the kind and distribution of the fauna, and the transport and deposition of food material (126). Although autochthonous primary production by diatoms, other algae, and macrophytes is significant in some situations (99, 107, 119, 162), the preponderance of allochthonous inputs to streams is emphasized in recent literature (24, 31, 36, 39, 70, 97, 99, 111, I12, 116, 162). Hynes (73) suggested that the watershed, rather than the stream,, should be the basic unit of study because of the dependence of the stream on inputs of organic and inorganic material, and Ross (132) showed that the distribution of some stream taxa was associated with the distribution of the riparian vegetation. In viewing a stream as a continuum from headwaters to mouth, the influence of riparian vegetation and its litter contribution will vary with stream order and position along the continuum (33, 34; R. L. Vannote, personal communication). The degradation of detritus in streams is extremely complex. Such aspects as preconditioning in the terrestrial habitat, physical abrasion, leaching, and microbial colonization are discussed only briefly, as our focus is primarily on the role of macroinvertebrates. The functional feeding group concept of Cummin(s3 1, 32) is adopted for comparing detritivore groups. Historically, leaf litter has been considered the major allochthonous input to streams. However, we place considerable emphasis on wood debris in this review because its importance to streams has received little attention previously.},

abstract = {The prototypical representatives of the Euryarchaeota--the methanogens--are oxygen sensitive and are thought to occur only in highly reduced, anoxic environments. However, we found methanogens of the genera Methanosarcina and Methanocella to be present in many types of upland soils (including dryland soils) sampled globally. These methanogens could be readily activated by incubating the soils as slurry under anoxic conditions, as seen by rapid methane production within a few weeks, without any additional carbon source. Analysis of the archaeal 16S ribosomal RNA gene community profile in the incubated samples through terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and quantification through quantitative PCR indicated dominance of Methanosarcina, whose gene copy numbers also correlated with methane production rates. Analysis of the $\delta$(13)C of the methane further supported this, as the dominant methanogenic pathway was in most cases aceticlastic, which Methanocella cannot perform. Sequences of the key methanogenic enzyme methyl coenzyme M reductase retrieved from the soil samples before incubation confirmed that Methanosarcina and Methanocella are the dominant methanogens, though some sequences of Methanobrevibacter and Methanobacterium were also detected. The global occurrence of only two active methanogenic archaea supports the hypothesis that these are autochthonous members of the upland soil biome and are well adapted to their environment.},

abstract = {Local species richness is a function of many factors operating at multiple spatial and temporal scales.We examined stream fish communities from regions throughout Virginia to assess (1) the relative influence of local vs. regional factors on local species richness, (2) evidence for community saturation, and (3) scale dependency of regional influences. We defined regions at four spatial scales: major drainages, drainage-physiog- raphy units, hydrologic-physiography units, and sites. We used multiple regression to iden- tify key correlates of local native and introduced diversity for each regional scale. Both local (e.g., microhabitat diversity) and regional (e.g., species richness) factors were co related with local diversity; regional diversity was the most consistent correlate. Plots of local vs. regional native diversity were asymptotic for the three largest regional definitions, thereby suggesting community saturation. However, analogous plots for introduced species were not asymptotic; local introduced diversity was a linear function of regional introduced diversity. Introduced populations were pervasive, but less abundant locally than native populations, thereby suggesting that native species are better adapted. Overall, stream fish communities in Virginia appeared to be neither completely saturated nor freely invadable. The ability of regression models and particular independent variables to account for variation in local diversity changed considerably with regional scale. Most regional correlates of local diversity were scale dependent. The concept of hierarchical environmental filters provides a useful framework for integrating the multiple scales over which ecological processes organize communities. Retrospective analyses of the impacts of introduced spe- cies on native communities provide some insight regarding community saturation, but conclusive evidence must await studies that couple comparative and experimental approaches. Clear interpretation of regional influences on local diversity will require careful definition of regions. Comparative analyses at multiple regional scales may be the most insightful approach to understanding the complete array of processes that organize communities.},

abstract = {How biological diversity is generated and maintained is a fundamental question in ecology. Ecologists have delineated many mechanisms that can, in principle, favor species coexistence and hence maintain biodiversity. Most such coexistence mechanisms require or imply tradeoffs between different aspects of species performance. However, it remains unknown whether simple functional tradeoffs underlie coexistence mechanisms in diverse natural systems. We show that functional tradeoffs explain species differences in long-term population dynamics that are associated with recovery from low density (and hence coexistence) for a community of winter annual plants in the Sonoran Desert. We develop a new general framework for quantifying the magnitude of coexistence via the storage effect and use this framework to assess the strength of the storage effect in the winter annual community. We then combine a 25-year record of vital rates with morphological and physiological measurements to identify functional differences between species in the growth and reproductive phase of the life cycle that promote storage-effect coexistence. Separation of species along a tradeoff between growth capacity and low-resource tolerance corresponds to differences in demographic responses to environmental variation across years. Growing season precipitation is one critical environmental variable underlying the demographic decoupling of species. These results demonstrate how partially decoupled population dynamics that promote local biodiversity are associated with physiological differences in resource uptake and allocation between species. These results for a relatively simple system demonstrate how long-term community dynamics relate to functional biology, a linkage scientists have long sought for more complex systems.},

We show that previous attempts to prove that n species cannot coexist on fewer that n resources (the "competitive exclusion principle") all make use of the very restrictive assumption that the specific growth rates of all competing species are linear functions of resource densities. When this restriction is relaxed, it becomes possible to find situations in which n species can coexist on fewer than n resources. On the basis of this and other observations we conclude that the competitive exclusion principle should be considered to apply only to coexistence at fixed densities.},

abstract = {Every plant species examined to date harbors endophytic fungi within its asymptomatic aerial tissues, such that endophytes represent a ubiquitous, yet cryptic, component of terrestrial plant communities. Fungal endophytes associated with leaves of woody angiosperms are especially diverse; yet, fundamental aspects of their interactions with hosts are unknown. In contrast to the relatively species-poor endophytes that are vertically transmitted and act as defensive mutualists of some temperate grasses, the diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angiosperms are thought to contribute little to host defense. Here, we document high diversity, spatial structure, and host affinity among foliar endophytes associated with a tropical tree (Theobroma cacao, Malvaceae) across lowland Panama. We then show that inoculation of endophyte-free leaves with endophytes isolated frequently from naturally infected, asymptomatic hosts significantly decreases both leaf necrosis and leaf mortality when T. cacao seedlings are challenged with a major pathogen (Phytophthora sp.). In contrast to reports of fungal inoculation inducing systemic defense, we found that protection was primarily localized to endophyte-infected tissues. Further, endophyte-mediated protection was greater in mature leaves, which bear less intrinsic defense against fungal pathogens than do young leaves. In vitro studies suggest that host affinity is mediated by leaf chemistry, and that protection may be mediated by direct interactions of endophytes with foliar pathogens. Together, these data demonstrate the capacity of diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angiosperms to play an important but previously unappreciated role in host defense.},

abstract = {Aim An intensively debated issue in macroecology is whether unicellular organ- isms show biogeographic patterns different from those of macroorganisms. One aspect of this debate addresses beta diversity, that is, do microbial organisms exhibit distance-decay patterns similar to those of macroorganisms? And if so, is the decay of community similarity caused by spatially limited dispersal or by niche-related factors? We studied the community similarity of stream diatoms, macroinverte- brates and bryophytes across the same set of sites in relation to environmental and geographic distance. Location A geographical gradient of c. 1100 km in Finland. Methods We first identified the subset of environmental variables that produced the highest correlation with community similarities for each taxonomic group. Based on these variables, we used partial Mantel tests to separate the independent influences of environmental and geographical distance for distance decay of com- munity similarity, separately for diatoms, bryophytes and macroinvertebrates. Finally,macroinvertebrates were divided into three groups based on their different dispersal categories and a partial Mantel test was used to assess whether each of these groupswere differently affected by environmental versus geographic distance, i.e. is dispersal a key factor in tests of niche versus neutral models. Results The level of environmental control was by far the strongest for diatoms; however, all groups were controlled more by environmental factors than by limited dispersal. Macroinvertebrate species with low dispersal ability were significantly related to geographic distance, while more effective dispersers showed no relation- ship to geography but were instead strongly related to environmental distance. Main conclusions Our results suggest that patterns between macro- and micro- organisms are not fundamentally different, but the level of environmental control varies according to dispersal ability. The relative importance of niche versus dis- persal processes is not simply a function of organism size but other traits (e.g. life-history type, dispersal capacity) may obscure this relationship.},

abstract = {Fine-scale estimation of recombination rates remains a challenging problem. Experimental techniques can provide accurate estimates at fine scales but are technically challenging and cannot be applied on a genome-wide scale. An alternative source of information comes from patterns of genetic variation. Several statistical methods have been developed to estimate recombination rates from randomly sampled chromosomes. However, most such methods either make poor assumptions about recombination rate variation, or simply assume that there is no rate variation. Since the discovery of recombination hotspots, it is clear that recombination rates can vary over many orders of magnitude at the fine scale. We present a method for the estimation of recombination rates in the presence of recombination hotspots. We demonstrate that the method is able to detect and accurately quantify recombination rate heterogeneity, and is a substantial improvement over a commonly used method. We then use the method to reanalyze genetic variation data from the HLA and MS32 regions of the human genome and demonstrate that the method is able to provide accurate rate estimates and simultaneously detect hotspots.},

What specific underlying processes are essential for a macroecological pattern to emerge? Here, we analyze the analytical predictions of a general model suitable for describing the spatial biodiversity similarity in river ecosystems, and benchmark them against the empirical occurrence data of freshwater fish species collected in the Mississippi-Missouri river system. Encapsulating immigration, emigration, and stochastic noise, and without resorting to species abundance data, the model is able to reproduce the observed probability distribution of the Jaccard similarity index at any given distance. In addition to providing an excellent agreement with the empirical data, this approach accounts for heterogeneities of different subbasins, suggesting a strong dependence of biodiversity similarity on their respective climates. Strikingly, the model can also predict the actual probability distribution of the Jaccard similarity index for any distance when considering just a relatively small sample. The proposed framework supports the notion that simplified macroecological models are capable of predicting fundamental patterns-a theme at the heart of modern community ecology.},

The head organizer is located in the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) and the trunk organizer in the node and anterior primitive streak. In amphibians, Spemann's organizer, which is homologous to the node, partially overlaps with anterior endoderm cells expressing homologues of the AVE markers cerberus, Hex and Hesx1. For mice, this raises the question of whether the AVE and node are independent of each other, as suggested by their anatomical separation, or functionally interdependent as is the case in amphibians. Chordin and Noggin are secreted bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonists expressed in the mouse node, but not in the AVE. Here we show that mice double-homozygous mutants that are for chordin and noggin display severe defects in the development of the prosencephalon. The results show that BMP antagonists in the node and its derivatives are required for head development.},

abstract = {Legacy ejfects of past land use and disturbance are increasingly recognized, yet consistent definitions of and criteria for defining them do not exist. To address this gap in biological- and ecosystem-assessment frameworks, we propose a general metric for evaluating potential legacy effects, which are computed by normalizing altered system function persistence with duration of disturbance. We also propose two distinct legacy-effect categories: signal effects from lags in transport and structural effects from physical landscape changes. Using flux records for water, sediment, nitrogen, and carbon from long-term study sites in the eastern United States from 1500 to 2000, we identify gaps in our understanding of legacy effects and reveal that changes in basin sediment dynamics precede instrumented records. These sediment dynamics are not generally incorporated into interpretations of contemporary records, although their potential legacy effects are substantial. The identification of legacy effects may prove to be a fundamental component of landscape management and effective conservation and restoration practice.},

abstract = {The metacommunity framework explores the relative influence of local and regional-scale processes in generating diversity patterns across the landscape. Metacommunity models and empirical studies have focused mostly on assemblages of competing organisms within a single trophic level. Studies of multi-trophic metacommunities are predominantly restricted to simplified trophic motifs and rarely consider entire food webs. We tested the ability of the patch-dynamics, speciessorting, mass-effects, and neutral metacommunity models, as well as three hybrid models, to reproduce empirical patterns of food web structure and composition in the complex aquatic food web found in the northern pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea. We used empirical data to determine regional species pools and estimate dispersal probabilities, simulated local food-web dynamics, dispersed species from regional pools into local food webs at rates based on the assumptions of each metacommunity model, and tested their relative fits to empirical data on food-web structure. The species-sorting and patch-dynamics models most accurately reproduced nine food web properties, suggesting that local-scale interactions were important in structuring Sarraceniafood webs. However, differences in dispersal abilities were also important in models that accurately reproduced empirical food web properties. Although the models were tested using pitcher-plant food webs, the approach we have developed can be applied to any well-resolved food web for which data are available from multiple locations.},

Unlike resistant mutants, cells regrown from such persistent bacteria remain sensitive to the antibiotic. We investigated the persistence of single cells of Escherichia coli with the use of microfluidic devices. Persistence was linked to preexisting heterogeneity in bacterial populations because phenotypic switching occurred between normally growing cells and persister cells having reduced growth rates. Quantitative measurements led to a simple mathematical description of the persistence switch. Inherent heterogeneity of bacterial populations may be important in adaptation to fluctuating environments and in the persistence of bacterial infections.},

Recent advances in theory and analysis have focused on multi-locus approaches and on combined analysis of molecular and ecological data. However, broad environmental surveys of bacterial diversity still rely on single-locus data, notably 16S ribosomal DNA, and little other detailed information. Evolutionary methods of delimiting species from single-locus data alone need to consider population genetic and macroevolutionary theories for the expected levels of interspecific and intraspecific variation. We discuss the use of a recent evolutionary method, based on the theory of coalescence within independently evolving populations, compared with a traditional approach that uses a fixed threshold divergence to delimit species.},

Nonetheless, genes are commonly labelled as 'adaptive' if an allele has been shown to affect a phenotype with known or suspected functional importance or if patterns of nucleotide variation at the locus are consistent with positive selection. In these cases, the 'adaptive' designation may be premature and may lead to incorrect conclusions about the relationships between gene function and fitness.

Here we investigate the importance of environmental complexity in determining the evolution of niche width over approximately 900 generations in a chemically defined experimental system. We propagated 120 replicate lines of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens in environments of different complexity by using between one and eight carbon substrates in each environment. Genotypes from populations selected in complex environments evolved greater mean and variance in fitness than those from populations selected in simple environments. Thus, lineages were able to adapt to several substrates simultaneously without any appreciable loss of function with respect to other substrates present in the media. There was greater genetic and genotype-by-environment interaction variance for fitness within populations selected in complex environments. It is likely that genetic variance in populations grown on complex media was maintained because the identity of the fittest genotype varied among carbon substrates. Our results suggest that evolution in complex environments will result neither in narrow specialists nor in complete generalists but instead in overlapping imperfect generalists, each of which has become adapted to a certain range of substrates but not to all.},

Studies of adaptive evolution of temperature tolerance have typically involved correlative analyses of natural populations or artificial selection experiments in the laboratory. Field experiments are required to provide estimates of the timing and strength of natural selection, enhance understanding of the genetics of adaptation and yield insights into the mechanisms driving evolutionary change. Here, we report the experimental evolution of cold tolerance in natural populations of threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We show that freshwater sticklebacks are able to tolerate lower minimum temperatures than marine sticklebacks and that this difference is heritable. We transplanted marine sticklebacks to freshwater ponds and measured the rate of evolution after three generations in this environment. Cold tolerance evolved at a rate of 0.63 haldanes to a value 2.5°C lower than that of the ancestral population, matching values found in wild freshwater populations. Our results suggest that cold tolerance is under strong selection and that marine sticklebacks carry sufficient genetic variation to adapt to changes in temperature over remarkably short time scales.},

abstract = {Aim Beta diversity can be partitioned into two components: dissimilarity due to species replacement and dissimilarity due to nestedness (Baselga, 2010, Global Ecology and Biogeography, 19, 134–143). Several contributions have challenged this approach or proposed alternative frameworks. Here, I review the concepts and methods used in these recent contributions, with the aim of clarifying: (1) the rationale behind the partitioning of beta diversity into species replacement and nestedness-resultant dissimilarity, (2) how, based on this rationale, numerators and denominators of indices have to match, and (3) how nestedness and nestedness-resultant dissimilarity are related but different concepts. Innovation The rationale behind measures of species replacement (turnover) dictates that the number of species that are replaced between sites (numerator of the index) has to be relativized with respect to the total number of species that could potentially be replaced (denominator). However, a recently proposed partition of Jaccard dissimilarity fails to do this. In consequence, this partition underestimates the contribution of species replacement and overestimates the contribution of richness differences to total dissimilarity. I show how Jaccard dissimilarity can be partitioned into meaningful turnover and nestedness components, and extend these new indices to multiple-site situations. Finally the concepts of nestedness and nestedness-resultant dissimilarity are discussed. Main conclusions Nestedness should be assessed using consistent measures that depend both on paired overlap and matrix filling, e.g. NODF, whereas beta-diversity patterns should be examined using measures that allow the total dissimilarity to be separated into the components of dissimilarity due to species replacement and dissimilarity due to nestedness. In the case of multiple-site dissimilarity patterns, averaged pairwise indices should never be used because the mean of the pairwise values is unable to accurately reflect the multiple-site attributes of dissimilarity.},

abstract = {Some authors have suggested that prey species stand to benefit most by defending as early as possible during predator-prey encounters, but species in nature employ antipredator defenses at various stages of interactions with their predators. Whether it is generally most advantageous to defend early or late during such encounters is an open theoretical question. We model conditions under which a prey species might evolve early or late defenses in response to predation. Adapting a two-prey, one-predator Rosenzweig-MacArthur system of differential equations, we analyze the effects of modified antipredator defenses (and their associated costs) on the ability of a new prey type to invade the one-prey, one-predator limiting system at equilibrium. We show that the outcome, in terms of invasion potential, is crucially dependent on the ratio of the prey's proportional population growth rate to the cost of predator encounters.},

abstract = {In many aquatic ecosystems, most microbes live in matrix-enclosed biofilms and contribute substantially to energy flow and nutrient cycling. Little is known, however, about the coupling of structure and dynamics of these biofilms to ecosystem function. Here we show that microbial biofilms changed the physical and chemical microhabitat and contributed to ecosystem processes in 30-m-long stream mesocosms. Biofilm growth increased hydrodynamic transient storage-streamwater detained in quiescent zones, which is a major physical template for ecological processes in streams-by 300{\%} and the retention of suspended particles by 120{\%}. In addition, by enhancing the relative uptake of organic molecules of lower bioavailability, the interplay of biofilm microarchitecture and mass transfer changed their downstream linkage. As living zones of transient storage, biofilms bring hydrodynamic retention and biochemical processing into close spatial proximity and influence biogeochemical processes and patterns in streams. Thus, biofilms are highly efficient and successful ecological communities that may also contribute to the influence that headwater streams have on rivers, estuaries and even oceans through longitudinal linkages of local biogeochemical and hydrodynamic processes.},

Here, we combine recent findings from geophysics, microbial ecology and organic geochemistry to show geophysical opportunity and microbial capacity to enhance the net heterotrophy in streams, rivers and estuaries. We identify hydrological storage and retention zones that extend the residence time of organic carbon during downstream transport as geophysical opportunities for microorganisms to develop as attached biofilms or suspended aggregates, and to metabolize organic carbon for energy and growth. We consider fluvial networks as meta-ecosystems to include the acclimation of microbial communities in downstream ecosystems that enable them to exploit energy that escapes from upstream ecosystems, thereby increasing the overall energy utilization at the network level. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {1. We monitored streamwater and streambed sediment porewaters from White Clay Creek (WCC), SE Pennsylvania, for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved oxygen (DO) and conductivity to investigate organic matter processing within the hyporheic zone. Dissolved organic carbon and DO concentrations were higher in the streamwater than in the porewaters and, in many cases, concentrations continued to diminish with increasing depth into the streambed. 2. Hydrological exchange data demonstrated that the permeability of the stream bed declines with depth and constrains downwelling, effectively isolating porewaters {\textgreater}30 cm from streamwater. 3. End-member mixing analysis (EMMA) based on conductivity documented a DOC source and DO sink in the hyporheic zone. We calculated hyporheic streambed DOC fluxes and respiration from the EMMA results and estimates of water flux. Based upon our calculations of biodegradable DOC entering the hyporheic zone, we estimate that DOC supports 39{\%} of the hyporheic zone respiration, with the remaining 61{\%} presumably being supported by entrained particulate organic carbon. Hyporheic respiration averaged 0.38 g C m-2 d-1, accounted for 41{\%} of whole ecosystem respiration, and increased baseflow ecosystem efficiency from 46 to 59{\%}. 4. Advective transport of labile organic molecules into the streambed concentrates microbial activity in near-surface regions of the hyporheic zone. Steep gradients in biogeochemical activity could explain how a shallow and hydrologically constrained hyporheic zone can dramatically influence organic matter processing at the ecosystem scale.},

abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change and stratospheric ozone destruction. Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) loading to river networks is a potentially important source of N(2)O via microbial denitrification that converts N to N(2)O and dinitrogen (N(2)). The fraction of denitrified N that escapes as N(2)O rather than N(2) (i.e., the N(2)O yield) is an important determinant of how much N(2)O is produced by river networks, but little is known about the N(2)O yield in flowing waters. Here, we present the results of whole-stream (15)N-tracer additions conducted in 72 headwater streams draining multiple land-use types across the United States. We found that stream denitrification produces N(2)O at rates that increase with stream water nitrate (NO(3)(-)) concentrations, but that {\textless}1{\%} of denitrified N is converted to N(2)O. Unlike some previous studies, we found no relationship between the N(2)O yield and stream water NO(3)(-). We suggest that increased stream NO(3)(-) loading stimulates denitrification and concomitant N(2)O production, but does not increase the N(2)O yield. In our study, most streams were sources of N(2)O to the atmosphere and the highest emission rates were observed in streams draining urban basins. Using a global river network model, we estimate that microbial N transformations (e.g., denitrification and nitrification) convert at least 0.68 Tg{\textperiodcentered}y(-1) of anthropogenic N inputs to N(2)O in river networks, equivalent to 10{\%} of the global anthropogenic N(2)O emission rate. This estimate of stream and river N(2)O emissions is three times greater than estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.},

Since the first papers on the subject appeared, two perspectives have developed to describe how communities shift from one stable state to another. One assumes a constant environment with shifts in variables such as population density, and the other anticipates changes to underlying parameters or environmental "drivers". We review the theory behind alternative stable states and examine to what extent these perspectives are the same, and in what ways they differ. We discuss the concepts of resilience and hysteresis, and the role of stochasticity within the two formulations. In spite of differences in the two perspectives, the same type of experimental evidence is required to demonstrate the existence of alternative stable states.},

abstract = {The patterns of abundance generated by a simple stochastic birth-death-immigration model are described in order to characterize the diversity of neutral communities of ecologically equivalent species. Diversity is described by species number S and the variance of frequency or log abundance q approximately. The frequency distribution of abundance is very generally lognormal, skewed to the left by immigration and resembling descriptions of natural communities. Increased immigration and community size always cause S to increase. Their effect on q approximately is more complicated, but given biologically reasonable assumptions, S and q approximately will be positively correlated in most circumstances. Larger samples contain more species; the graph of log S on log individuals, equivalent to a species-area curve, is generally convex upward but becomes linear with a slope of about +0.25 when immigration is low and births exceed deaths. When individuals invade a new, vacant environment, both S and q approximately increase through time. Thus, a positive correlation between S and q approximately will usually be generated when sites of differing size or age are surveyed. At equilibrium, communities maintain roughly constant levels of S and q approximately but change in composition through time; composition may remain similar, however, for many generations. Many prominent patterns observed in natural communities can therefore be generated by a strictly neutral model. This does not show that community structure is determined exclusively by demographic stochasticity, but rather demonstrates the necessity for an appropriate null model when functional hypotheses are being tested.},

abstract = {Populations subject to severe stress may be rescued by natural selection, but its operation is restricted by ecological and genetic constraints. The cost of natural selection expresses the limited capacity of a population to sustain the load of mortality or sterility required for effective selection. Genostasis expresses the lack of variation that prevents many populations from adapting to stress. While the role of relative fitness in adaptation is well understood, evolutionary rescue emphasizes the need to recognize explicitly the importance of absolute fitness. Permanent adaptation requires a range of genetic variation in absolute fitness that is broad enough to provide a few extreme types capable of sustained growth under a stress that would cause extinction if they were not present. This principle implies that population size is an important determinant of rescue. The overall number of individuals exposed to selection will be greater when the population declines gradually under a constant stress, or is progressively challenged by gradually increasing stress. In gradually deteriorating environments, survival at lethal stress may be procured by prior adaptation to sublethal stress through genetic correlation. Neither the standing genetic variation of small populations nor the mutation supply of large populations, however, may be sufficient to provide evolutionary rescue for most populations.},

abstract = {Darwin insisted that evolutionary change occurs very slowly over long periods of time, and this gradu-alist view was accepted by his supporters and incorporated into the infinitesimal model of quantitative genetics developed by R. A. Fisher and others. It dominated the first century of evolutionary biology, but has been challenged in more recent years both by field surveys demonstrating strong selection in natural populations and by quantitative trait loci and genomic studies, indicating that adaptation is often attributable to mutations in a few genes. The prevalence of strong selection seems inconsistent, however, with the high heritability often observed in natural populations, and with the claim that the amount of morphological change in contemporary and fossil lineages is independent of elapsed time. I argue that these discrepancies are resolved by realistic accounts of environmental and evolutionary changes. First, the physical and biotic environment varies on all time-scales, leading to an indefinite increase in environmental variance over time. Secondly, the intensity and direction of natural selection are also likely to fluctuate over time, leading to an indefinite increase in phenotypic variance in any given evolving lineage. Finally, detailed long-term studies of selection in natural populations demon-strate that selection often changes in direction. I conclude that the traditional gradualist scheme of weak selection acting on polygenic variation should be supplemented by the view that adaptation is often based on oligogenic variation exposed to commonplace, strong, fluctuating natural selection.},

abstract = {The central themes of community ecology-distribution, abundance, and diversity-display strongly marked and very general patterns. These include the log-normal distribution of abundance, the relation between range and abundance, the species-area law, and the turnover of species composition. Each pattern is the subject of a large literature that interprets it in terms of ecological processes, typically involving the sorting of differently specialized species onto heterogeneous landscapes. All of these patterns can be shown to arise, however, from neutral community models in which all individuals have identical properties, as the consequence of local dispersal alone. This implies, at the least, that functional interpretations of these patterns must be reevaluated. More fundamentally, neutral community models provide a general theory for biodiversity and conservation biology capable of predicting the fundamental processes and patterns of community ecology.},

We tracked the eco-evolutionary dynamics of metapopulations with a laboratory model system of yeast exposed to salt stress. Metapopulations experienced environmental deterioration at three different rates and their component populations were either unconnected or connected by local dispersal or by global dispersal. We found that adaptation was favored by gradual deterioration and local dispersal. After further abrupt deterioration, the frequency of evolutionary rescue depended on both the prior rate of deterioration and the rate of dispersal. Adaptation was surprisingly frequent and rapid in small peripheral populations. Thus, evolutionary dynamics affect both the persistence and the range of a species after environmental deterioration.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of global change and its impacts on biodiversity poses a clear and urgent challenge for evolutionary biologists. In many cases, environmental change is so widespread and rapid that individuals can neither accommodate to them physiologically nor migrate to a more favourable site. Extinction will ensue unless the population adapts fast enough to counter the rate of decline. According to theory, whether populations can be rescued by evolution depends upon several crucial variables: population size, the supply of genetic variation, and the degree of maladaptation to the new environment. Using techniques in experimental evolution we tested the conditions for evolutionary rescue (ER). Hundreds of yeast populations were exposed to normally lethal concentrations of salt in conditions, where the frequency of rescue mutations was estimated and population size was manipulated. In a striking match with theory, we show that ER is possible, and that the recovery of the population may occur within 25 generations. We observed a clear threshold in population size for ER whereby the ancestral population size must be sufficiently large to counter stochastic extinction and contain resistant individuals. These results demonstrate that rapid evolution is an important component of the response of small populations to environmental change.},

abstract = {Ecologits have seached for general principles, or assembly rules, which determine how species combine to form communities. Two major strands of research highlight the interaction of assembly rules operating at different levels of community organisation, and within uncertain local and historical contingencies. Here, we review the literature on community assembly within the context of three principal determinants; dispersal constraints, environmental constraints and internal dynamics. This classification separates external factors (dispersal and environmental constraints) from internal processes (internal dynamics). We assert that assembly rules are general, determinitic and mechanistic, and operate on internal dynamics within the constraints imposed by the local environment and the history of species invasions. Several assembly rules have been proposed to operate within and across trophic levels, as well as on whole systems. The rules act through resource dunamics and spatial dynamics to select species or subsets of species that can coexist, and may lead to patterns of increasing biomass and non-random spatial distributions. Environmental constraints, either exogenous or endogenous, may drive community change. Even in systems at equilibrium, environmental constraints influence outcome of assembly rules. Dispersal constraints determine the pool of potential colonists available at a particular time and place, and are a complex amalgam of species-specific traits, storage effects, landscape ecology, and history. The order and timing of species invasions (dispersal constraints) interact with assembly rules to produce priority effects. The directionality of community assembly may be lost if either the rate at which species invasions or the rate of non-selective species extinctions exceeds the rate at which species are selected by assembly rules. The falling apart, or disassembly, of a community through breakdown of species interactions may follow different rules or a different assembly trajectory.},

abstract = {The priming effect refers to quantitative changes in microbial decomposition of recalcitrant organic matter upon addition of labile organic matter and is a phenomenon that mainly has been reported and debated in soil science. Recently, priming effects have been indicated in aquatic ecosystems and have received attention due to the potential significance for ecosystem carbon budgets. Headwater stream biofilms, which are important degraders of both allochthonous, presumably recalcitrant, organic matter and labile autochthonous organic matter, may be sites where priming effects are important in aquatic environments. We have experimentally tested for priming effects in stream biofilms within microcosms mimicking the stream hyporheic zone. A (13)C labeled model allochthonous carbon source was used in combination with different carbon sources simulating autochthonous inputs. We did not detect changes in respiration, removal or incorporation of allochthonous organic matter in response to autochthonous treatments, thus not supporting the occurrence of priming effects under the experimental conditions. This study is the first to address priming effects in the hyporheic zone, and one of very few studies quantitatively assessing aquatic priming effects. The results contrast with existing studies, which highlights the need for quantitative approaches to determine the importance of priming effects in aquatic environments.},

abstract = {Although mathematical models and laboratory experiments have shown that species interactions can generate chaos, field evidence of chaos in natural ecosystems is rare. We report on a pristine rocky intertidal community located in one of the world's oldest marine reserves that has displayed a complex cyclic succession for more than 20 y. Bare rock was colonized by barnacles and crustose algae, they were overgrown by mussels, and the subsequent detachment of the mussels returned bare rock again. These processes generated irregular species fluctuations, such that the species coexisted over many generations without ever approaching a stable equilibrium state. Analysis of the species fluctuations revealed a dominant periodicity of about 2 y, a global Lyapunov exponent statistically indistinguishable from zero, and local Lyapunov exponents that alternated systematically between negative and positive values. This pattern indicates that the community moved back and forth between stabilizing and chaotic dynamics during the cyclic succession. The results are supported by a patch-occupancy model predicting similar patterns when the species interactions were exposed to seasonal variation. Our findings show that natural ecosystems can sustain continued changes in species abundances and that seasonal forcing may push these nonequilibrium dynamics to the edge of chaos.},

Stream water has been collected and chemically analyzed since 1963 in six experimental watersheds at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest; thus, we were able to examine the effect of this severe natural disturbance on watershed nutrient export and changes in instream nitrate (NO3-) processing. The ice storm caused large increases in watershed export of NO3- for 2 years after the disturbance, but our examination of in-stream processing suggests that NO3- losses would have been much more dramatic had there not been an increase in in-stream, nitrogen-processing efficiency after the ice storm. The canopy damage that resulted from the ice storm led to increased light availability and large inputs of woody debris to the stream. We suspect that increases in algal production and storage and processing of terrestrial litter account for the increase in inorganic nitrogen processing in these streams. Our results indicate that, without in-stream processing, export of NO3- from the damaged watersheds would have been 80-140{\%} higher than was observed. These results point to an intriguing negative feedback mechanism whereby the same disturbance that causes watershed NO3- loss may simultaneously lead to increased in-stream retention and transformation.},

abstract = {Abstract   Although they drain remarkably similar forest types, streams of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) vary widely in their NO3 − concentrations during the growing season. This variation may be caused by differences in the terrestrial systems they drain (for example, varying forest age or composition, hydrology, soil organic matter content, and so on) and/or by differences between the streams themselves (for example, contrasting geomorphology, biotic nitrogen [N] demand, rates of instream nitrogen transformations). We examined interstream variation in N processing by measuring NH4 + and NO3 − uptake and estimating nitrification rates for 13 stream reaches in the HBEF during the summers of 1998 and 1999. We modeled nitrification rates using a best-fit model of the downstream change in NO3 − concentrations following short-term NH4 + enrichments. Among the surveyed streams, the fraction of NH4 + uptake that was subsequently nitrified varied, and this variation was positively correlated with ambient streamwater NO3 − concentrations. We examined whether this variation in instream nitrification rates contributed significantly to the observed variation in NO3 − concentrations across streams. In some cases, instream nitrification provided a substantial portion of instream NO3 − demand. However, because there was also substantial instream NO3 − uptake, the net effect of instream processing was to reduce rather than supplement the total amount of NO3 − exported from a watershed. Thus, instream rates of nitrification in conjunction with instream NO3 − uptake were too low to account for the wide range of streamwater NO3 −. The relationship between streamwater NO3 − concentration and rates of instream nitrification may instead be due to a shift in the competitive balance between heterotrophic N uptake and nitrification when external inputs of NO3 − are relatively high.},

abstract = {1. Rates of whole-system metabolism (production and respiration) are fundamental indicators of ecosystem structure and function. Although first-order, proximal controls are well understood, assessments of the interactions between proximal controls and distal controls, such as land use and geographic region, are lacking. Thus, the influence of land use on stream metabolism across geographic regions is unknown. Further, there is limited understanding of how land use may alter variability in ecosystem metabolism across regions. 2. Stream metabolism was measured in nine streams in each of eight regions (n = 72) across the United States and Puerto Rico. In each region, three streams were selected from a range of three land uses: agriculturally influenced, urban-influenced, and reference streams. Stream metabolism was estimated from diel changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations in each stream reach with correction for reaeration and groundwater input. 3. Gross primary production (GPP) was highest in regions with little riparian vegetation (sagebrush steppe in Wyoming, desert shrub in Arizona/New Mexico) and lowest in forested regions (North Carolina, Oregon). In contrast, ecosystem respiration (ER) varied both within and among regions. Reference streams had significantly lower rates of GPP than urban or agriculturally influenced streams. 4. GPP was positively correlated with photosynthetically active radiation and autotrophic biomass. Multiple regression models compared using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) indicated GPP increased with water column ammonium and the fraction of the catchment in urban and reference land-use categories. Multiple regression models also identified velocity, temperature, nitrate, ammonium, dissolved organic carbon, GPP, coarse benthic organic matter, fine benthic organic matter and the fraction of all land-use categories in the catchment as regulators of ER. 5. Structural equation modelling indicated significant distal as well as proximal control pathways including a direct effect of land-use on GPP as well as SRP, DIN, and PAR effects on GPP; GPP effects on autotrophic biomass, organic matter, and ER; and organic matter effects on ER. 6. Overall, consideration of the data separated by land-use categories showed reduced inter-regional variability in rates of metabolism, indicating that the influence of agricultural and urban land use can obscure regional differences in stream metabolism.},

abstract = {The autosomal-recessive form of popliteal pterygium syndrome, also known as Bartsocas-Papas syndrome, is a rare, but frequently lethal disorder characterized by marked popliteal pterygium associated with multiple congenital malformations. Using Affymetrix 250K SNP array genotyping and homozygosity mapping, we mapped this malformation syndrome to chromosomal region 21q22.3. Direct sequencing of RIPK4 (receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase protein 4) showed a homozygous transversion (c.362T{\textgreater}A) that causes substitution of a conserved isoleucine with asparagine at amino acid position 121 (p.Ile121Asn) in the serine/threonine kinase domain of the protein. Additional pathogenic mutations-a homozygous transition (c.551C{\textgreater}T) that leads to a missense substitution (p.Thr184Ile) at a conserved position and a homozygous one base-pair insertion mutation (c.777778insA) predicted to lead to a premature stop codon (p.Arg260ThrfsX14) within the kinase domain-were observed in two families. Molecular modeling of the kinase domain showed that both the Ile121 and Thr184 positions are critical for the protein's stability and kinase activity. Luciferase reporter assays also demonstrated that these mutations are critical for the catalytic activity of RIPK4. RIPK4 mediates activation of the nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) signaling pathway and is required for keratinocyte differentiation and craniofacial and limb development. The phenotype of Ripk4(-/-) mice is consistent with the human phenotype presented herein. Additionally, the spectrum of malformations observed in the presented families is similar, but less severe than the conserved helix-loop-helix ubiquitous kinase (CHUK)-deficient human fetus phenotype; known as Cocoon syndrome; this similarity indicates that RIPK4 and CHUK might function via closely related pathways to promote keratinocyte differentiation and epithelial growth.},

abstract = {Question/Location: We modelled lichen epiphyte biomass in relation to topography, stand structure, and lichen community composition in the central Cascades of western Oregon. Methods: Sampling was stratified by stand structure. Epiphyte biomass was estimated based on lichen litter for three functional groups: cyanolichens, forage lichens, and matrix lichens. Regression models for estimating lichen biomass ( {\$}log{\_}{\{}10{\}} kg.ha{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} ) were developed based on three pools of predictors, each pool demanding different levels of effort to obtain the data. First, we created models from topographic predictors that are easily extracted from GIS data. We then developed models based on both topographic and stand-structure variables. Finally, we developed models using topography, stand structure, and lichen community data. Results/Conclusions: Lichen biomass changed with elevation, cyanolichen biomass highest at low elevations (470-950 m) and forage lichen biomass highest at higher elevations (950-1470 m). Lichen biomass was lowest in even-aged young stands and highest in mature stands with remnant trees and in old-growth. Stands with remnant trees had more lichen biomass than even-aged stands. Models with the greatest explanatory power were: cyanolichen biomass predicted as a function of elevation, stand age index, the sum of Lobaria oregana and L. pulmonaria abundance, and cyanolichen species richness (R2 = 0.85); forage lichen biomass predicted as a function of stand age index and, Alectoria sarmentosa abundance (R2 = 0.55); and matrix lichen biomass predicted as a function of stand age index and matrix lichen abundance (R2 = 0.58). These models are useful tools for understanding and predicting the distribution of epiphytic macrolichen biomass at a landscape scale.},

abstract = {Streams and rivers form conspicuous networks on the Earth and are among nature's most effective integrators. Their dendritic structure reaches into the terrestrial landscape and accumulates water and sediment en route from abundant headwater streams to a single river mouth. The prevailing view over the last decades has been that biological diversity also accumulates downstream. Here, we show that this pattern does not hold for fluvial biofilms, which are the dominant mode of microbial life in streams and rivers and which fulfil critical ecosystem functions therein. Using 454 pyrosequencing on benthic biofilms from 114 streams, we found that microbial diversity decreased from headwaters downstream and especially at confluences. We suggest that the local environment and biotic interactions may modify the influence of metacommunity connectivity on local biofilm biodiversity throughout the network. In addition, there was a high degree of variability in species composition among headwater streams that could not be explained by geographical distance between catchments. This suggests that the dendritic nature of fluvial networks constrains the distributional patterns of microbial diversity similar to that of animals. Our observations highlight the contributions that headwaters make in the maintenance of microbial biodiversity in fluvial networks.},

Previous work has demonstrated that negative soil community feedback can contribute to the coexistence of equivalent competitors. In this paper, I show that negative soil community feedback can also contribute to the coexistence of strong competitors, maintaining plant species that would not coexist in the absence of soil community dynamics. I review the evidence for soil community feedback and find accumulating evidence that soil community feedback can be common, strongly negative, and generated by a variety of complementary soil microbial mechanisms, including host-specific changes in the composition of the rhizosphere bacteria, nematodes, pathogenic fungi, and mycorrhizal fungi.

abstract = {1 Although its importance for plant mineral nutrition and nutrient cycling has long been recognized, the soil community has rarely been integrated into dynamical frameworks of plant populations, in spite of abundant evidence for its involvement. The concept of feedback may provide theoretical and experimental tools for investigating the importance of the soil community in the population ecology and evolution of plants. 2 A mathematical model demonstrates the potential for two divergent dynamics, with positive feedback leading to the loss of diversity at a local scale and negative feedback leading to its maintenance. A linear contrast of the growth of plants in association with their own soil communities compared to the growth of plants in association with each others' soil communities can be used to differentiate between these possibilities in empirical studies. 3 Spatially explicit computer simulations demonstrate that the dynamics of a spatially structured community, as the soil community is likely to be, can differ from those predicted for a well-mixed population. Specifically, diversity can be maintained between locally homogeneous patches when positive feedback and dispersal occur at local scales. 4 Using a simple experimental protocol, we have found substantial negative feedback on plant growth through the soil community, suggesting that it may be involved in the maintenance of plant species diversity. 5 We discuss the importance of the soil community in other areas of plant ecology and evolution, including the suggestion that interactions with the soil community may be involved in the maintenance of sexual or asexual reproductive systems},

abstract = {A major goal of microbial ecology is to identify links between microbial community structure and microbial processes. Although this objective seems straight forward, there are conceptual and methodological challenges to designing studies that explicitly evaluate this link. Here, we analyzed literature documenting structure and process responses to manipulations to determine the frequency of structure-process links and whether experimental approaches and techniques influence link detection. We examined nine journals (published 2009-13) and retained 148 experimental studies measuring microbial community structure and processes. Many qualifying papers (112 of 148) documented structure and process responses, but few (38 of 112 papers) reported statistically testing for a link. Of these tested links, 75{\%} were significant and typically used Spearman or Pearson's correlation analysis (68{\%}). No particular approach for characterizing structure or processes was more likely to produce significant links. Process responses were detected earlier on average than responses in structure or both structure and process. Together, our findings suggest that few publications report statistically testing structure-process links. However, when links are tested for they often occur but share few commonalities in the processes or structures that were linked and the techniques used for measuring them.},

abstract = {Human activities affect both the amount and configuration of habitat. These changes have important ecological implications that can be measured as changes in landscape connectivity. I investigated how urbanization interacts with the initial amount and aggregation of habitat to change dispersal potential, restoration potential, and the risk of spatially extensive disturbances. I used a factorial set of simulated landscapes and subjected each landscape to habitat loss by overlaying 66 different US urban areas. I used a common connectivity metric, CONNECT, to assess the magnitude and direction of changes for a range of dispersal distances. My results show that the relationship between habitat loss and connectivity loss is non-linear and subject to interactions between the spatial patterns of habitat distribution, urban morphology, and dispersal capabilities. The implications of a given urban form vary widely as a function of habitat distribution and dispersal capabilities. This implies that impact assessments, restoration activities, and conservation planning should consider historical habitat distribution when evaluating observed changes in connectivity. While my results clearly show that more aggregated or continuous habitats are more vulnerable to connectivity loss, this approach can also be used to identify landscapes where restoring connectivity will be particularly effective, for example through placement of stepping stone habitats.},

abstract = {The extent to which the distribution of soil bacteria is controlled by local environment vs. spatial factors (e.g. dispersal, colonization limitation, evolutionary events) is poorly understood and widely debated. Our understanding of biogeographic controls in microbial communities is likely hampered by the enormous environmental variability encountered across spatial scales and the broad diversity of microbial life histories. Here, we constrained environmental factors (soil chemistry, climate, above-ground plant community) to investigate the specific influence of space, by fitting all other variables first, on bacterial communities in soils over distances from m to 102 km. We found strong evidence for a spatial component to bacterial community structure that varies with scale and organism life history (dispersal and survival ability). Geographic distance had no influence over community structure for organisms known to have survival stages, but the converse was true for organisms thought to be less hardy. Community function (substrate utilization) was also shown to be highly correlated with community structure, but not to abiotic factors, suggesting nonstochastic determinants of community structure are important Our results support the view that bacterial soil communities are constrained by both edaphic factors and geographic distance and further show that the relative importance of such constraints depends critically on the taxonomic resolution used to evaluate spatio-temporal patterns of microbial diversity, as well as life history of the groups being investigated, much as is the case for macro-organisms.},

abstract = {The metacommunity concept provides a spatial perspective on community$\backslash$ndynamics, and the landscape provides the physical template for a$\backslash$nmetacommunity. Several aspects of landscape heterogeneity, such as$\backslash$nlandscape diversity and composition, and characteristics of the matrix$\backslash$nbetween habitat patches such as habitat connectivity, and geometry$\backslash$nof habitat patches, may moderate metacommunity processes. These aspects$\backslash$nof landscape heterogeneity are rarely considered explicitly in the$\backslash$nmetacommunity discussion, however. We propose landscape contrast$\backslash$n(i.e., the average dissimilarity in habitat quality between neighboring$\backslash$npatches) as a key dimension of landscape heterogeneity. The concept$\backslash$nof landscape contrast unifies discrete and continuous landscape representations$\backslash$n(homogeneous, gradient, mosaic and binary) and offers a means to$\backslash$nintegrate landscape heterogeneity in the metacommunity concept. Landscape$\backslash$ncontrast as perceived by the organisms affects several fundamental$\backslash$nmetacommunity processes and may thus constrain which metacommunity$\backslash$nmodels may be observed. In a review of empirical metacommunity studies$\backslash$n( n = 123), only 22 {\%} of studies were explicit about their underlying$\backslash$nlandscape model assumptions, with striking differences among taxonomic$\backslash$ngroups.

Theoretical studies highlight how synchronizing mechanisms such as dispersal, regionally correlated climatic variables and mobile enemies might interact with local dynamics to produce different patterns of spatial covariance. Specialized statistical methods, applied to large-scale survey data, aid in testing the theoretical predictions with empirical estimates. Observational studies and experiments on the demography of local populations are paramount to identify the true ecological mechanisms. The recent achievements illustrate the power of combining theory, observation and/or experimentation and statistical modeling in the ecological research protocol.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new way of using forward selection of explanatory variables in regression or canonical redundancy analysis. The classical forward selection method presents two problems: a highly inflated Type I error and an overestimation of the amount of explained variance. Correcting these problems will greatly improve the performance of this very useful method in ecological modeling. To prevent the first problem, we propose a two-step procedure. First, a global test using all explanatory variables is carried out. If, and only if, the global test is significant, one can proceed with forward selection. To prevent overestimation of the explained variance, the forward selection has to be carried out with two stopping criteria: (1) the usual alpha significance level and (2) the adjusted coefficient of multiple determination (R2a) calculated using all explanatory variables. When forward selection identifies a variable that brings one or the other criterion over the fixed threshold, that variable is rejected, and the procedure is stopped. This improved method is validated by simulations involving univariate and multivariate response data. An ecological example is presented using data from the Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah, USA.},

abstract = {We examined the principal effects of different information network topologies for local adaptive management of natural resources. We used computerized agents with adaptive decision algorithms with the following three fundamental constraints: (1) Complete understanding of the processes maintaining the natural resource can never be achieved, (2) agents can only learn by experimentation and information sharing, and (3) memory is limited. The agents were given the task to manage a system that had two states: one that provided high utility returns (desired) and one that provided low returns (undesired). In addition, the threshold between the states was close to the optimal return of the desired state. We found that networks of low to moderate link densities significantly increased the resilience of the utility returns. Networks of high link densities contributed to highly synchronized behavior among the agents, which caused occasional large-scale ecological crises between periods of stable and high utility returns. A constructed network involving a small set of experimenting agents was capable of combining high utility returns with high resilience, conforming to theories underlying the concept of adaptive comanagement. We conclude that (1) the ability to manage for resilience (i.e., to stay clear of the threshold leading to the undesired state as well as the ability to re-enter the desired state following a collapse) resides in the network structure and (2) in a coupled social-ecological system, the system-wide state transition occurs not because the ecological system flips into the undesired state, but because managers lose their capacity to reorganize back to the desired state.},

abstract = {We determined the responses of a model laboratory community to resource enrichment and compared these responses to the predictions of prey-dependent and ratio- dependent food chain models. Our model community consisted of Escherichia coli B and bacteriophage T4 in chemostats supplied with different concentrations of glucose. We ob- served the following responses to enrichment: (1) a large and highly significant increase in the equilibrium population density of the predator, bacteriophage T4, (2) a small but significant increase in the equilibrium population density of the prey, E. coli, and (3) a large and highly significant decrease in the stability of both the predator and prey popu- lations. These responses were better predicted by a prey-dependent model (altered to include a time delay between consumption and reproduction by predators) than by a ratio-dependent model. Enrichment had a large effect on evolutionary change in our system. Enrichment significantly decreased the amount of time required for mutants of E. coli that were resistant to predation by bacteriophage to appear in the chemostats. Enrichment also significantly increased the rate at which these bacteriophage-resistant mutants invaded the chemostats. These results were also better predicted by the prey-dependent model. Invasion by bacte- riophage-resistant mutants had a large effect on the subsequent population dynamics of both predator and prey. Both the equilibrium density and stability of the E. coli population increased following invasion, and the population shifted from being primarily limited by predators to being primarily limited by resources. After invasion by the mutants, the T4 population decreased in equilibrium density, and the population cycled with an increased period. These results were compared to the predictions of a ratio-dependent model and a prey-dependent model altered to include T4-resistant mutants. The dynamics of this com- munity were better predicted by the modified prey-dependent model; however, this model was more complex mathematically than the simpler ratio-dependent model.},

abstract = {A major goal of community ecology is to link biological processes at lower scales with community patterns. Microbial communities are especially powerful model systems for making these links. In this article, we review recent studies of laboratory communities of bacteria and bacteriophage (viruses that infect bacteria). We focus on the ecology and evolution of bacteriophage-resistance as a case study demonstrating the relationship between specific genes, individual interactions, population dynamics, community structure, and evolutionary change. In laboratory communities of bacteria and bacteriophage, bacteria rapidly evolve resistance to bacteriophage infection. Different resistance mutations produce distinct resistance phenotypes, differing, for example, in whether resistance is partial or complete, in the magnitude of the physiological cost associated with resistance, and in whether the mutation can be countered by a host-range mutation in the bacteriophage. These differences determine whether a mutant can invade, the effect its invasion has on the population dynamics of sensitive bacteria and phage, and the resulting structure of the community. All of these effects, in turn, govern the community's response to environmental change and its subsequent evolution.},

abstract = {Trade-offs among the abilities of organisms to respond to different environmental factors are often assumed to play a major role in the coexistence of species. There has been extensive theoretical study of the role of such trade-offs in ecological communities but it has proven difficult to study such trade-offs experimentally. Microorganisms are ideal model systems with which to experimentally study the causes and consequences of ecological trade-offs. In model communities of E. coli B and T-type bacteriophage, a trade-off in E. coli between resistance to bacteriophage and competitive ability is often observed. This trade-off can allow the coexistence of different ecological types of E. coli. The magnitude of this trade-off affects, in predictable ways, the structure, dynamics and response to environmental change of these communities. Genetic factors, environmental factors, and gene-by-environment interactions determine the magnitude of this trade-off. Environmental control of the magnitude of trade-offs represents one avenue by which environmental change can alter community properties such as invasability, stability and coexistence.},

abstract = {Recent theory predicts that productivity can influence the relative importance of predation and competition in determining patterns in abundance, diversity, and community structure. In low-productivity systems, competition is predicted to be the major influence on community patterns, while at high productivity, the major influence is predicted to be predation. We directly tested this theory using a laboratory model community. Our model community consisted of the bacteriophage T2 (a virus that feeds on Escherichia coli) and two populations of E. coli, in glucose-limited chemostats. One E. coli population consisted of individuals that were sensitive to predation by T2 ("vulnerable" E. coli), and the other population consisted of individuals that were partially resistant to predation by T2 ("less vulnerable" E. coli). We manipulated productivity in this experiment by running replicate chemostats with different input concentrations of glucose, Our observations were consistent with theoretical predictions. We observed the decline of the more vulnerable prey population at higher productivity but not at lower productivity, and the decline of the less vulnerable prey population at lower productivity but not at higher productivity. However, the rate of decline in some replicates was slower than predicted, and extinctions were not observed during the experiments, contrary to theoretical predictions. We present some testable hypotheses that might explain the slow rate of decline observed.},

Our model food chain consisted of the bacterium Escherichia coli and the bacteriophage T4 (a virus that feeds on E. coli) in chemostats supplied with different concentrations of glucose. The E. coli population consisted of individuals that were susceptible to predation by T4 ('edible' E. coli) and individuals that were resistant to predation by T4 ('inedible' E. coli). The equilibrium density of a heterogeneous prey population (consisting of edible and inedible E. coli) increased strongly in response to an enrichment of its resources. This response consisted of an increase in the inedible fraction of the prey population but no change in the edible fraction. In contrast, a homogeneous prey population (edible E. coli only) increased only marginally. The equilibrium density of the predator population (bacteriophage T4) did not significantly increase in response to enrichment when its prey were heterogeneous, but it increased strongly when its prey were homogeneous.},

abstract = {Traditional expectations for how widely and how often freshwater invertebrates disperse differ from empirical data. Freshwater invertebrates have been characterized as frequent, widespread dispersers, particularly those that are transported passively. Our review finds that this characterization may describe the potential for dispersal in some taxa, but it is not an accurate generalization for actual dispersal rates. High variance among habitats and taxonomic groups is a consistent theme. Advances in population genetics may help resolve these issues, but underlying assumptions should be carefully tested. Further, even unbiased estimates of gene flow may not equate with individual movement, because not all dispersers survive and reproduce. Some freshwater invertebrates may exist in classic Levins metapopulations. However, other species fit into a broader metapopulation definition, where temporal dispersal via diapause is functionally equivalent to spatial dispersal. In the latter case, local extinctions and rescue effects may be rare or absent. Finally, limited dispersal rates in many taxa suggest that theories of freshwater community assembly and structure can be made more robust by integrating dispersal and local processes as joint, contingent regulators. Recent research on freshwater invertebrate dispersal has substantially advanced our basic and applied understanding of freshwaters, as well as evolutionary ecology in general.},

Eight springs were investigated: four groundwater-fed springs in the floodplain, located at the bottom of the bank; and four interstitial-fed springs located at the downstream end of a gravel bar. During this period, the inflows of groundwater to the river represented an average input of 0.77 mg l(-1) of nitrogen (of which 93.3{\%} were nitrates), 0.0187 mg l(-1) of total phosphorus (of which 42.2{\%} was orthophosphate), 3.56 mg l(-1) of silica, 2.315 +/- 0.703 mg l(-1) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC, of which 47{\%} was biodegradable) and 7.3 x 10(4) +/- 3.7 x 10(4) bacteria per ml (of which 8.8{\%} were active). Silica, DOC, biodegradable DOG, and bacteria concentrations displayed temporal variations during the study, which seem to be linked to the biological activity of the groundwater biofilm. There was a strong heterogeneity between the two types of groundwater that flow to the river: concentrations of calcium and alkalinity were higher in bank springs than in gravel bars springs. In these latters, sulfate, sodium, nitrogen, phosphorus were significantly higher. [References: 32]},

abstract = {Most empirical and theoretical studies of resource use and population dynamics treat conspecific individuals as ecologically equivalent. This simplification is only justified if interindividual niche variation is rare, weak, or has a trivial effect on ecological processes. This article reviews the incidence, degree, causes, and implications of individual-level niche variation to challenge these simplifications. Evidence for individual specialization is available for 93 species distributed across a broad range of taxonomic groups. Although few studies have quantified the degree to which individuals are specialized relative to their population, between-individual variation can sometimes comprise the majority of the population's niche width. The degree of individual specialization varies widely among species and among populations, reflecting a diverse array of physiological, behavioral, and ecological mechanisms that can generate intrapopulation variation. Finally, individual specialization has potentially important ecological, evolutionary, and conservation implications. Theory suggests that niche variation facilitates frequency-dependent interactions that can profoundly affect the population's stability, the amount of intraspecific competition, fitness-function shapes, and the population's capacity to diversify and speciate rapidly. Our collection of case studies suggests that individual specialization is a widespread but underappreciated phenomenon that poses many important but unanswered questions.},

abstract = {Sympatric speciation, the evolution of reproductive isolation with- out geographic barriers, remains highly contentious. As a result of new empirical examples and theory, it is now generally accepted that sympatric speciation has occurred in at least a few instances, and is theoretically plausible. Instead, debate has shifted to whether sym- patric speciation is common, and whether models' assumptions are generally met in nature. The relative frequency of sympatric spe- ciation will be difficult to resolve, because biogeographic changes have obscured geographical patterns underlying many past specia- tion events. In contrast, progress is being made on evaluating the empirical validity of key theoretical conditions for sympatric spe- ciation. Disruptive selection and direct selection on mating traits, which should facilitate sympatric speciation, are biologically well supported. Conversely, costs to assortative mating are also widely documented, but inhibit speciation. Evaluating the joint incidence of these key factors may illuminate why sympatric speciation appears to be relatively uncommon.},

Seven different urban ecosystems have been identified: street trees; lawns/parks; urban forests; cultivated land; wetlands; lakes/sea; and streams. These systems generate a range of ecosystem services. In this paper, six local and direct services relevant for Stockholm are addressed: air filtration, micro climate regulation, noise reduction, rainwater drainage, sewage treatment, and recreational and cultural values. It is concluded that the locally generated ecosystem services have a substantial impact on the quality-of-life in urban areas and should be addressed in land-use planning.},

Fine benthic organic matter (FBOM, particles {\textless}1 mm) was collected eight times in 1995 and 1996 from settling ponds located at the base of five catchments, and assayed for total C, N and P, extractable ammonium, mineralisable N, organic P, labile polysaccharides, denitrification potential, acetylene reduction and respiration rates, and $\beta$-glucosidase and phosphatase activities. The five catchments (10-101 ha in size) are located in the Pacific North-west of the United States. They contain either old-growth forests dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) or stands that were harvested 30 years ago and replanted with Douglas-fir, with riparian zones dominated by red alder (Alnus rubra), bigleaf and vine maple (Acer macrophyllum; A. circinatum) and understory herbaceous plants. 2. C:N ratios were significantly higher, and mineralisable N, extractable ammonium and labile polysaccharides were all significantly lower, in FBOM from old-growth catchment sediment than in FBOM from catchments containing harvested stands, showing that the chemical characteristics of FBOM were influenced by forest harvest. C and N concentrations were greatest in sediment from old-growth catchments, but microbial activities (respiration, denitrification potential, phosphatase and $\beta$-glucosidase) tended to be greater in sediment from the harvested catchments. 3. Levels of certain chemical components of harvested-catchment FBOM were elevated relative to those found in old growth; specifically, organic and total P, extractable ammonium, mineralisable N and labile polysaccharides, suggesting that stream FBOM from harvested basins is more biodegradable than stream FBOM from old-growth basins. 4. In addition to effects of past timber harvest on FBOM characteristics, there were also significant seasonal differences in both logged and unlogged catchments in all variables except mineralisable N, labile polysaccharides and acetylene reduction rates. 5. The results indicate that past timber harvest in five river basins influenced both composition of and seasonal fluctuations in fine benthic organic matter (FBOM) collected from stream sediments in settling ponds, suggesting a linkage between forest harvest and stream productivity. 6. Comparisons between seasonal patterns in stream and settling pond sediment FBOM characteristics suggested that the readily decomposable organic matter entering sediments during a storm event are rapidly transported and decomposed during their movement through the catchment basin. It also showed the validity of studying settling pond sediments as a surrogate for mountain stream sediments.},

abstract = {We studied the metapopulation dynamics and persistence of an extinction-prone predator2013prey interaction. We show that the dynamics of the system are influenced by both stochastic and deterministic processes. Using host2013parasitoid metapopulation data, we develop appropriate descriptors of the local within-patch population dynamics. In particular, we show that the local dynamics are well described by a Markov chain. We show that the local dynamics are determined predominately by demographic stochastic processes and that the deterministic signal is relatively weak. To test the hypothesis that the persistence of predator2013prey metapopulations is affected by habitat size, local population dynamics and different types of (demographic or environmental) stochasticity, we fit population models to the regional metapopulation time-series. Contrary to expectations this demographic noise is, however, undetectable at the regional scale and is masked by an environmental noise process. We show that by linking patches together, the predicted environmental noise is effectively decreased as metapopulation size increases. Using a simple spatial stochastic model, we illustrate that the effects of demographic noise are masked rapidly at the regional scale due to the statistical effects of the central limit theorem. We discuss the implications of this for understanding the dynamics and persistence of metapopulations. Journal of Animal Ecology (2004) 73, 1043 20131055},

In both cases, spatial structuring plays a functional role in ecosystems. Ecological models should explicitly take into account the spatial structure of ecosystems. In previous work, we used a polynomial function of the geographic coordinates of the sampling sites to model broad-scale spatial variation in a canonical (regression-type) modelling context. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting and quantifying spatial patterns over a wide range of scales. This is obtained by eigenvalue decomposition of a truncated matrix of geographic distances among the sampling sites. The eigenvectors corresponding to positive eigenvalues are used as spatial descriptors in regression or canonical analysis. This method can be applied to any set of sites providing a good coverage of the geographic sampling area. This paper investigates the behaviour of the method using numerical simulations and an artificial pseudo-ecological data set of known properties.},

abstract = {Spatial structures may not only result from ecological interactions, they may also play an essential functional role in organizing the interactions. Modeling spatial patterns at multiple spatial and temporal scales is thus a crucial step to understand the functioning of ecological communities. PCNM (principal coordinates of neighbor matrices) analysis achieves a spectral decomposition of the spatial relationships among the sampling sites, creating variables that correspond to all the spatial scales that can be perceived in a given data set. The analysis then finds the scales to which a data table of interest responds. The significant PCNM variables can be directly interpreted in terms of spatial scales, or included in a procedure of variation decomposition with respect to spatial and environmental components. This paper presents four applications of PCNM analysis to ecological data representing combinations of: transect or surface data, regular or irregular sampling schemes, univariate or multivariate data. The data sets include Amazonian ferns, tropical marine zooplankton, chlorophyll in a marine lagoon, and oribatid mites in a peat bog. In each case, new ecological knowledge was obtained through PCNM analysis.},

abstract = {Although the canonical concept of intraguild predation evokes images of predators and prey, several subdisciplines within ecology have developed theory not specifically framed in terms of predation and competition and often using system-specific terminology, yet functionally quite similar. Here, we formulate models combining exploitation and competition in predator-prey, host-parasitoid, and host-pathogen communities to compare dynamics, food web structure, and coexistence criteria for these disparate communities. Although dynamic stability in the coexistence region varies strongly among systems, in all cases coexistence of two consumers on a single resource occurs only if the intraguild prey species is more efficient than the intraguild predator at suppressing the abundance of the basal resource, and if the intraguild predator accrues a sufficient gain from attacking the intraguild prey. In addition, equilibrial abundances of all species in all three formulations respond similarly to increases in productivity of the basal resource. Our understanding of predator-prey and parasitoid-host communities has benefited from explicit examination of intraguild predation (IGP) theory, and we suggest that future research examining pathogen communities, in particular, will benefit substantially from explicit recognition of predictions from IGP theory.},

abstract = {Much of the focus in evolutionary biology has been on the adaptive differentiation among organisms. It is equally important to understand the processes that result in similarities of structure among systems. Here, we discuss examples of similarities occurring at different ecological scales, from predator–prey relations (attack rates and handling times) through communities (food-web structures) to ecosystem properties. Selection among systemic configurations or patterns that differ in their intrinsic stability should lead generally to increased representation of relatively stable structures. Such nonadaptive, but selective processes that shape ecological communities offer an enticing mechanism for generating widely observed similarities, and have sparked new interest in stability properties. This nonadaptive systemic selection operates not in opposition to, but in parallel with, adaptive evolution.},

abstract = {Bacterial biomass, metabolic condition, and activity were measured over a 16-month period in the surface sediments of the following four field sites with differing dissolved organic matter regimes: a woodlot spring seep, a meadow spring seep, a second-order stream, and a third-order stream. Total bacterial biomass was measured by lipid phosphate and epifluorescence microscopic counts (EMC), and viable biomass was measured by C most probable number, EMC with 2-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride reduction, and ATP. Bacterial metabolic condition was determined from the percentage of respiring cells, poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, and adenylate energy charge. Activity measures included C-lipid synthesis, P-phospholipid synthesis, the rate of uptake of algal lysate dissolved organic carbon, and respiration, from which biosynthesis was calculated (dissolved organic carbon uptake corrected for respiration). Total bacterial biomass (from EMC) ranged from 0.012 to 0.354 mug of C/mg of dry sediment and was usually lowest in the third-order stream. The percentage of cells respiring was less than 25{\%} at all sites, indicating that most bacteria were dormant or dead. Adenylate energy charge was measured only in the third-order stream and was uniformly low. Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were greater in the woodlot spring seep than in the second- and third-order streams. Uptake of algal lysate dissolved organic carbon ranged from undetectable levels to 166 mg of C . m . h. Little community respiration could be attributed to algal lysate metabolism. Phospholipid synthesis ranged from 0.006 to 0.354 pmol . mg of dry sediment . h. Phospholipid synthesis rates were used to estimate bacterial turnover at the study sites. An estimated 375 bacterial generations per year were produced in the woodlot spring seep, and 67 per year were produced in the third-order stream.},

abstract = {Despite the critical position of nitrification in N cycling in coniferous forest soils of western North America, little information exists on the composition of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in these soils, or their response to treatments that promote or reduce nitrification. To this end, an experiment was conducted in which a set of soil cores was reciprocally transplanted between adjacent forest (low nitrification potential) and meadow (high nitrification potential) environments, at two high-elevation (approximately 1500 m) sites in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest located in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Half of the cores were placed in screened PVC pipe (closed) to prevent new root colonization, large litter debris inputs, and animal disturbance; the other cores were placed in open mesh bags. A duplicate set of open and closed soil cores was not transferred between sites and was incubated in place. Over the 2-year experiment, net nitrification increased in both open and closed cores transferred from forest to meadow, and to a lesser extent in cores remaining in the forest. In three of four forest soil treatments, net nitrification increases were accompanied by increases in nitrification potential rates (NPR) and 10- to 100-fold increases in AOB populations. In open cores remaining in the forests, however, increases in net nitrification were not accompanied by significant increases in either NPR or AOB populations. Although some meadow soil treatments reduced both net nitrification and nitrification potential rates, significant changes were not detected in most probable number (MPN)-based estimates of AOB population densities. Terminal restriction fragment profiles (T-RFs) of a PCR-amplified 491-bp fragment of the ammonia monooxygenase subunit A gene (amoA) changed significantly in response to some soil treatments, and treatment effects differed among locations and between years. A T-RF previously shown to be a specific biomarker of Nitrosospira cluster 4 (Alu390) was widespread and dominant in the majority of soil samples. Despite some treatments causing substantial increases in AOB population densities and nitrification potential rates, nitrosomonads remained undetectable, and the nitrosospirad AOB community composition did not change radically following treatment.},

Exchanges of water, nutrients, and organic matter occur in response to variations in discharge and bed topography and porosity. Upwelling subsurface water supplies stream organisms with nutrients while downwelling stream water provides dissolved oxygen and organic matter to microbes and invertebrates in the hyporheic zone. Dynamic gradients exist at all scales and vary temporally. At the microscale, gradients in redox potential control chemical and microbially mediated nutrient transformations occurring on particle surfaces. At the stream-reach scale, hydrological exchange and water residence time are reflected in gradients in hyporheic faunal composition, uptake of dissolved organic carbon, and nitrification. The hyporheic corridor concept describes gradients at the catchment scale, extending to alluvial aquifers kilometers from the main channel. Across all scales, the functional significance of the hyporheic zone relates to its activity and connection with the surface stream.},

abstract = {Over the last 25 y, stream ecosystem theory has expanded to include explicitly the vertical dimension of surface–groundwater linkages via the hyporheic zone and below alluvial floodplains. Hydrological exchange between the stream and hyporheic zone mediates transport of products from the biogeochemical activities within the sediments. Hot-spots of primary productivity in the surface stream often result from upwelling nutrient-rich water. Conversely, downwelling surface water supplies organic matter and dissolved O2 to hyporheic invertebrates and microbes, enhancing hyporheic productivity. Many of the papers seminal to conceptual and empirical advances in hyporheic research have been published in J-NABS, reflecting stream benthologists' awareness of the relevance of processes and biota in the hyporheic zone. However, major research gaps remain. One is the need for further empirical data to test the predictions of several current conceptual frameworks that hypothesize conditions under which the hyporheic zone might be expected to contribute most to surface stream metabolism, especially in large rivers with shallow alluvial aquifers. A second is how to apply research findings about the functional significance of the hyporheic zone to river restoration and conservation. Many activities that restore or protect surface biota and habitats probably benefit hyporheic processes and fauna as well, but this prediction should be tested. Last, hyporheic exchange and the biogeochemical processes within the sediments occur across multiple hierarchical spatial scales, but we are yet to understand fully these interactions or to extrapolate successfully across scales. J-NABS should continue to play a significant role in publishing research on the hyporheic zone and extend the scope to include applications in river and floodplain management and restoration.},

abstract = {Although bacteria are ubiquitous in the near-surface atmosphere and they can have important effects on human health, airborne bacteria have received relatively little attention and their spatial dynamics remain poorly understood. Owing to differences in meteorological conditions and the potential sources of airborne bacteria, we would expect the atmosphere over different land-use types to harbor distinct bacterial communities. To test this hypothesis, we sampled the near-surface atmosphere above three distinct land-use types (agricultural fields, suburban areas and forests) across northern Colorado, USA, sampling five sites per land-use type. Microbial abundances were stable across land-use types, with ∼10(5)-10(6) bacterial cells per m(3) of air, but the concentrations of biological ice nuclei, determined using a droplet freezing assay, were on average two and eight times higher in samples from agricultural areas than in the other two land-use types. Likewise, the composition of the airborne bacterial communities, assessed via bar-coded pyrosequencing, was significantly related to land-use type and these differences were likely driven by shifts in the sources of bacteria to the atmosphere across the land-uses, not local meteorological conditions. A meta-analysis of previously published data shows that atmospheric bacterial communities differ from those in potential source environments (leaf surfaces and soils), and we demonstrate that we may be able to use this information to determine the relative inputs of bacteria from these source environments to the atmosphere. This work furthers our understanding of bacterial diversity in the atmosphere, the terrestrial controls on this diversity and potential approaches for source tracking of airborne bacteria.},

abstract = {This study determined nitrification activity and nitrifier community composition in soils under stands of red alder (Alnus rubra) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) at two sites in Oregon. The H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, located in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, has low net N mineralization and gross nitrification rates. Cascade Head Experimental Forest, in the Coast Range, has higher net N mineralization and nitrification rates and soil pH is lower. Communities of putative bacterial [ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB)] and archaeal [ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA)] ammonia oxidizers were examined by targeting the gene amoA, which codes for subunit A of ammonia monooxygenase. Nitrification potential was significantly higher in red alder compared with Douglas-fir soil and greater at Cascade Head than H.J. Andrews. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria amoA genes were amplified from all soils, but AOA amoA genes could only be amplified at Cascade Head. Gene copy numbers of AOB and AOA amoA were similar at Cascade Head regardless of tree type (2.3-6.0 x 10(6)amoA gene copies g(-1) of soil). DNA sequences of amoA revealed that AOB were members of Nitrosospira clusters 1, 2 and 4. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria community composition, determined by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles, varied among sites and between tree types. Many of the AOA amoA sequences clustered with environmental clones previously obtained from soil; however, several sequences were more similar to clones previously recovered from marine and estuarine sediments. As with AOB, the AOA community composition differed between red alder and Douglas-fir soils.},

abstract = {In order to examine the effects of disturbance, vegetation type, and microclimate on denitrification and denitrifier community composition, experimental plots were established at the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Soil cores were reciprocally transplanted between meadow and forest and samples were collected after 1 and 2 years. Denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA) was measured using the acetylene block assay and terminal restriction length polymorphism profiles were generated with nosZ primers that target the gene coding for nitrous oxide reductase. Nitrate concentrations, C mineralization, and water content were measured to gain additional insights into soil properties controlling DEA. Meadow soils were significantly higher in DEA than forest soils, and the highest DEA levels were observed in cores transferred from the meadow into the forest. Nitrate concentrations were also different between forest and meadow soils, but did not correlate to DEA. DEA was higher in open versus closed cores, suggesting an association between denitrification and the rhizosphere. Denitrifier communities of undisturbed forest and meadow soils shifted through a 4-year period but remained distinct from each other. Similarly, denitrifier communities clustered by vegetation type of origin regardless of manipulation, suggesting that the overall denitrifier communities are well buffered against environmental changes. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A study was conducted at two experimental tree plantations in the Pacific Northwest to assess the roles of bacteria and fungi in nitrogen (N) cycling. Soils from red alder (Alnus rubra) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) plots in low- (H.J. Andrews) and high- (Cascade Head) productivity stands were sampled in 2005 and 2006. Fungal:bacterial ratios were determined using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and quantitative (Q)-PCR. Ratios from these two molecular methods were highly correlated and showed that microbial biomass varied significantly between the two experimental sites and to a lesser extent between tree types with fungal:bacterial biomass ratios lower in more N-rich plots. 15N isotope dilution experiments, with ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-), were paired with antibiotics that blocked bacterial (bronopol) and fungal (cycloheximide) protein synthesis. This modified isotope dilution technique was used to determine the relative contribution of bacteria and fungi to net N mineralization and gross rates of ammonification and nitrification. When bacterial protein synthesis was blocked NH4+ consumption and nitrification rates decreased in all treatments except for NH4+ consumption in the Douglas-fir plots at H.J. Andrews, suggesting that prokaryotic nitrifiers are a major sink for mineral NH4+ in forest soils with higher N availability. Cycloheximide consistently increased NH4+ consumption, however the trend was not statistically significant. Both antibiotics additions also significantly increased gross ammonification, which may have been due to continued activity of extra- and intracellular enzymes involved in producing NH4+ combined with the inhibition of NH4+ assimilation into proteins. The implication of this result is that microorganisms are likely a major sink for soil dissolved organic N (DON) in soils. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the short-term heterotrophic soil respiration is strongly and positively related to temperature. In the long-term, its response to temperature is uncertain. One reason for this is because in field experiments increases in respiration due to warming are relatively short-lived. The explanations proposed for this ephemeral response include depletion of fast-cycling, soil carbon pools and thermal adaptation of microbial respiration. Using a {\textgreater} 15 year soil warming experiment in a mid-latitude forest, we show that the apparent 'acclimation' of soil respiration at the ecosystem scale results from combined effects of reductions in soil carbon pools and microbial biomass, and thermal adaptation of microbial respiration. Mass-specific respiration rates were lower when seasonal temperatures were higher, suggesting that rate reductions under experimental warming likely occurred through temperature-induced changes in the microbial community. Our results imply that stimulatory effects of global temperature rise on soil respiration rates may be lower than currently predicted.},

DIRT plots, which include root trenching, aboveground litter exclusion, and doubling of litter inputs, have been established in forested ecosystems in the US and Europe that vary with respect to dominant tree species, soil C content, N deposition rate, and soil type. This study used phospholipid fatty-acid (PLFA) analysis to examine changes in the soil microbial community size and composition in the mineral soil (0-10 cm) as a result of the DIRT treatments. At all sites, the PLFA profiles from the plots without roots were significantly different from all other treatments. PLFA analysis showed that the rootless plots generally contained larger quantities of actinomycete biomarkers and lower amounts of fungal biomarkers. At one of the sites in an old-growth coniferous forest, seasonal changes in PLFA profiles were also examined. Seasonal differences in soil microbial community composition were greater than treatment differences. Throughout the year, treatments without roots continued to have a different microbial community composition than the treatments with roots, although the specific PLFA biomarkers responsible for these differences varied by season. These data provide direct evidence that root C inputs exert a large control on microbial community composition in the three forested ecosystems studied.},

abstract = {The chemical composition and quantity of plant inputs to soil are primary factors controlling the size and structure of the soil microbial community. Little is known about how changes in the composition of the soil microbial community affect decomposition rates and other ecosystem functions. This study examined the degradation of universally 13C-labeled glucose, glutamate, oxalate, and phenol in soil from an old-growth Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)-western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) forest in the Oregon Cascades that has experienced 7 y of chronic C input manipulation. The soils used in this experiment were part of a larger Detritus Input and Removal Treatment experiment and have received normal C inputs (control), doubled wood inputs, or root and litter input exclusion (no inputs). Soil from the doubled wood treatment had a higher fungal:bacterial ratio, and soil from the no inputs treatment had a lower fungal:bacterial ratio, than the control soil. Differences in the utilization of the compounds added to the field-manipulated soils were assessed by following the 13C tracer into microbial biomass and respiration. In addition, 13C-phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis was used to examine differential microbial utilization of the added substrates. Glucose and glutamate were metabolized similarly in soils of all three litter treatments. In contrast, the microbial community in the double wood soil respired more added phenol and oxalate, whereas microbes in the no inputs soil respired less added phenol and oxalate, than the control soil. Phenol was incorporated primarily into fungal PLFA, especially in soil of the double wood treatment. The addition of all four substrates led to enhanced degradation of soil organic matter (priming) in soils of all three litter treatments, and was greater following the addition of phenol and oxalate as compared to glucose and glutamate. Priming was greater in the no inputs soil as compared to the control or doubled wood soils. These results demonstrate that altering plant inputs to soil can lead to changes in microbial utilization of C compounds. It appears that many of these changes are the result of alteration in the size and composition of the microbial community. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A laboratory experiment confirmed that the presence of this predator induced a change in body morphology in the carp. Estimation of prey vulnerability to predation by pike, a gape-limited predator, revealed that this increase in body depth resulted in crucian carp reaching a size that provided refuge from predation. However, this change in morphology incurs a cost through an increase in drag when the carp are swimming. Because crucian carp are limited by resources in the absence of piscivores and by the substantial cost of the defensive morph in their presence, phenotypic plasticity should be the optimal strategy for this species.},

abstract = {1. Increasingly, ecologists conceptualize local communities as connected to a regional species pool rather than as isolated entities. By this paradigm, community structure is determined through the relative strengths of dispersal-driven regional effects and local environmental factors. However, despite explicit incorporation of dispersal, metacommunity models and frameworks often fail to capture the realities of natural systems by not accounting for the configuration of space within which organisms disperse. This shortcoming may be of particular consequence in riverine networks which consist of linearly -arranged, hierarchical, branching habitat elements. Our goal was to understand how constraints of network connectivity in riverine systems change the relative importance of local vs. regional factors in structuring communities. 2. We hypothesized that communities in more isolated headwaters of riverine networks would be structured by local forces, while mainstem sections would be structured by both local and regional processes. We examined these hypotheses using a spatially explicit regional analysis of riverine macroinvertebrate communities, focusing on change in community similarity with distance between local communities [i.e., distance-decay relationships; (DDRs)], and the change in environmental similarity with distance. Strong DDRs frequently indicate dispersal-driven dynamics. 3. There was no evidence of a DDR in headwater communities, supporting our hypothesis that dispersal is a weak structuring force. Furthermore, a positive relationship between community similarity and environmental similarity supported dynamics driven by local environmental factors (i.e., species sorting). In mainstem habitats, significant DDRs and community x environment similarity relationships suggested both dispersal-driven and environmental constraints on local community structure (i.e., mass effects). 4. We used species traits to compare communities characterized by low vs. high dispersal taxa. In headwaters, neither strength nor mode (in-network vs. out of network) of dispersal changed our results. However, outcomes in mainstems changed substantially with both dispersal mode and strength, further supporting the hypothesis that regional forces drive community dynamics in mainstems. 5. Our findings demonstrate that the balance of local and regional effects changes depending on location within riverine network with local (environmental) factors dictating community structure in headwaters, and regional (dispersal driven) forces dominating in mainstems.},

We examined the diffusion properties of terracotta clay saucers, of types often used as components in phosphorus-diffusing substrata for investigating nutrient limitation of epilithic algae. 2. Laboratory experiments showed that phosphorus diffusion was low and inconsistent (0.06-2.6 mg P day(-1)) through clay saucers filled with agar containing orthophosphate. Similarly, in situ release of phosphorus from two types of terracotta clay saucers (Australian and Italian) was variable (2-8 mg P day(-1); 5-25{\%}) under three flow regimes (0, 0.1 and 0.3 m s(-1)) over 30 days, with most phosphorus being released during the first day. Clogging of pores by agar appears to prevent the diffusion of phosphorus through the terracotta clay saucers. However, the two types of terracotta clay saucer also irreversibly sorbed large quantities of phosphorus (40-140 mg P). 3. Individual saucers can have markedly different physical and chemical properties both within and among terracotta types. Terracotta saucers also contain large quantities of iron, calcium and aluminium that are known binding agents for phosphorus. Variability in saucer composition and diffusion properties makes treatments difficult to replicate and weakens comparisons between studies that have used terracotta with different clay composition and manufacture. 4. We recommend that phosphorus-diffusing substrata should not be constructed from terracotta clay components.},

abstract = {How environmental conditions and population processes determine the abundance and distribution of species is a central problem of ecology and biogeography. Although it has long been recognized hat abundance and distribution are intimately interrelated, the nature of this relationship has not been investigated systematically over the range of spatial scales from local populations to entire geographic ranges of species. On a local scale, i.e., the small habitat patches that constitute most ecologists' study areas, the relationship between population den- sity and spatial distribution of individuals has been studied by many population and community ecologists (e.g., Andrewartha and Birch 1954; Krebs 1978, and numerous references therein). Distribution on a large geographic scale has usually been regarded as the special province of biogeography, whose practitioners often have little experience or interest in population ecology (but see, e.g., Grinnell 1922; MacArthur 1972; Walter 1979; Rapoport 1982; Brown and Gibson 1983). Thus few investigators have systematically studied variation in population density over the geographic range of species. Recently, however, several authors have presented data that suggest a general relationship between local population den- sity and spatial distribution on a geographic scale (e.g., Rabinowitz 1981; Hanski 1982a, 1982b, 1982c; Bock and Ricklefs 1983; J. T. Emlen et al., MS). Here I reanalyze and synthesize some of the diverse information available on the relationship between abundance and distribution. These data suggest ex- tremely general patterns within and among species that appear to hold for organ- isms as diverse as vascular plants, intertidal invertebrates, terrestrial arthropods, planktonic crustaceans, and terrestrial vertebrates. I develop a general theory to explain these relationships. This conceptual construct and the empirical observa- tions that motivated it focus attention on problems that span the boundaries between the traditional disciplines of population ecology, community ecology, biogeography, population genetics, and evolution. Clarification of terminology should facilitate understanding of what follows. The paper is concerned with the relationship between two attributes of popula- tions and species: the density of individuals within a local area and the extent of the distribution of individuals in space. I shall often use the term abundance to refer to local population density, and the terms rare and common (or abundant) to describe extremes of density. Similarly, I shall often use distribution or range to refer to spatial distribution, and the terms restricted (or local) and widespread to describe the extremes.},

abstract = {An analysis of the distribution of the small boreal mammals (excluding bats) on isolated mountaintops in the Great Basin led to the following conclusions: 1. The species-area curve is considerably steeper (z = .43) than the curves usually obtained for insular biotas. 2. There is no correlation between number of species of boreal mammals and variables which are likely to affect the probability of colonization, such as distance between island and mainland, distance between islands, and elevation of intervening passes. Apparently the present rate of immigration of boreal mammals to isolated mountains is effectively zero. 3. Paleontological evidence suggests that the mountains were colonized by a group of species during the Pleistocene when the climatic barriers that currently isolate them were abolished. 4. Subsequent to isolation of the mountains, extinctions have reduced the faunal diversity to present levels. Probability of extinction is inversely related to population size and, therefore, is influenced by body size, diet, and habitat. The rate of extinction has been low, and all of the islands still have one or more species of boreal mammals. 5. The mammalian faunas of the mountaintops are true relicts and do not represent equilibria between rates of colonization and extinction.},

abstract = {North American desert rodents have long been a model system for the$\backslash$nstudy of community structure and dynamics. Field experiments and$\backslash$nnonmanipulative observations have provided consistent evidence that$\backslash$ninterspecific competition influences spatial patterns and dynamic$\backslash$nprocesses of community organization. Some of the evidence comes from$\backslash$nassembly rules, which document how the species that coexist in local$\backslash$ncommunities differ in body size, trophic morphology, functional group,$\backslash$nor taxonomy more than would be expected had they been assembled by$\backslash$nsome random process (Kelt and Brown 1999). One assembly rule proposed$\backslash$nby Fox (1987; see also Fox and Brown 1993; Fox 1999; Kelt et al.$\backslash$n1999) is based on functional groups. It hypothesizes that species$\backslash$nare assembled in such a way that each functional group tends to be$\backslash$nfilled before an additional species is added to an existing functional$\backslash$ngroup. Communities that conform to the rule are termed "favored states,"$\backslash$nwhereas other combinations are termed "unfavored states." So if the$\backslash$nrule is operating, we should observe more favored states than expected$\backslash$nby chance. Although Fox's assembly rule has been applied to a variety$\backslash$nof systems (1999), its application to desert rodent communities has$\backslash$ngenerated controversy. Fox and Brown (1993) showed that there were$\backslash$nmore favored states than expected by chance in two large data sets:$\backslash$na sample of 115 communities from the Nevada test site (Jorgensen$\backslash$nand Hayward 1965) and another sample of 201 communities from sites$\backslash$nwidely distributed across the southwestern United States (Brown and$\backslash$nKurzius 1987). Stone et al. (1996; also Simberloff et al. 1999) criticized$\backslash$nFox and Brown, claiming that the apparent conformity to the assembly$\backslash$nrule was an "artifact" of "the fact that the few widespread species$\backslash$nare not treated realistically" (Stone et al. 1996, p. 997). They$\backslash$nfocused on the southwestern data set and argued that the nonrandom$\backslash$npattern of coexistence was due entirely to the sizes and overlaps$\backslash$nof geographic ranges of different species. Kelt and Brown (1999)$\backslash$nand Brown et al. (2000) showed that this was not true. They determined$\backslash$nthe regional species pool for each sample site, composed of just$\backslash$nthose species whose geographic ranges overlapped the site, and then$\backslash$nassembled null communities by drawing the observed number of species$\backslash$nat random from these geographically constrained pools. Their analysis$\backslash$nshowed that the communities obeyed Fox's assembly rule: the observed$\backslash$nassemblages exhibited significantly more favored states than the$\backslash$nrandom draws from the regional pools. Stone et al. (2000) apparently$\backslash$naccepted this result, because in this most recent critique they barely$\backslash$nreferred to the influence of geographic ranges on the patterns of$\backslash$ncoexistence in the southwestern data set. Instead, Stone et al. (2000)$\backslash$nshifted fromthe geographical to the regional scale. They focused$\backslash$non the Nevada data set, where the restricted area insured that all$\backslash$nof the 115 sample sites were within the geographic ranges of the$\backslash$nsame species. They also shifted their argument, suggesting that the$\backslash$nnonrandom patterns of local coexistence are "an artifact of the fact$\backslash$nthat the assembly rule treated all species as equally likely to be$\backslash$nfound on all sites" (Stone et al. 2000, p. 323). They supported this$\backslash$nclaim by performing two analyses of the Nevada data set.},

abstract = {Comparative, quantitative biogeographic studies are revealing empirical patterns of interspecific variation in the sizes, shapes, boundaries, and internal structures of geographic ranges; these patterns promise to contribute to understanding the historical and ecological processes that influence the distributions of species. This review focuses on characteristics of ranges that appear to reflect the influences of environmental limiting factors and dispersal. Among organisms as a whole, range size varies by more than 12 orders of magnitude. Within genera, families, orders, and classes of plants and animals, range size often varies by several orders of magnitude, and this variation is associated with variation in body size, popu- lation density, dispersal mode, latitude, elevation, and depth (in marine systems). The shapes of ranges and the dynamic changes in range boundaries reflect the interacting influences of limiting environmental conditions (niche variables) and dispersal/extinction dynamics. These processes also presumably account for most of the internal structure of ranges: the spatial patterns and orders-of-magnitude of variation in the abundance of species among sites within their ranges. The results of this kind of "ecological biogeography" need to be integrated with the results of phylogenetic and paleoenvironmental approaches to "historical biogeography" so we can better understand the processes that have determined the geographic distributions of organisms},

Giving up densities, the density of re- sources within a patch at which an individual ceases foraging, provide considerably more infor- mation than simply the amount of resources har- vested. The giving up density of a forager, which is behaving optimally, should correspond to a har- vest rate that just balances the metabolic costs of foraging, the predation cost of foraging, and the missed opportunity cost of not engaging in alterna- tive activities. In addition, changes in giving up densities in response to climatic factors, predation risk, and missed opportunities can be used to test the model and to examine the consistency of the foragers' behavior. The technique was applied to a community of four Arizonan granivorous ro- dents (Perognathus amplus, Dipodomys merriami, Ammospermophilus harrisii, and Spermophilus tere- ticaudus).

abstract = {Mammalian predator-prey systems are behaviorally sophisticated games of stealth and fear. But, traditional mass-action models of predator prey dynamics treat individuals as behav- iorally unresponsive "molecules" in Brownian motion. Foraging theory should provide the conceptual framework to envision the interaction. But, current models of predator feeding behavior generally envision a clever predator consuming large numbers of sessile and behaviorally inert prey (e.g., kangaroo rats, Dipodomys, collecting seeds from food patches). Here, we extend foraging theory to consider a predator-prey game of stealth and fear and then embed this game into the modeling of predator-prey population dynamics. The melding of the prey and predator's optimal behaviors with their population and com- munity-level consequences constitutes the ecology of fear. The ecology of fear identifies the endpoints of a continuum of N-driven (population size) versus pL-driven (fear) systems. In N-driven systems, the major direct dynamical feedback involves predators killing prey, whereas j-driven systems involve the indirect effects from changes in fear levels and prey catchability. In pL-driven systems, prey respond to predators by becoming more vigilant or by moving away from suspected predators. In this way, a predator (e.g., mountain lion, Puma concolor) depletes a food patch (e.g., local herd of mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus) by frightening prey rather than by actually killing prey. Behavior buffers the system: a reduction in predator numbers should rapidly engender less vigilant and more catchable prey. The ecology of fear explains why big fierce carnivores should be and can be rare. In carnivore},

The fecundity distribution refers to the expected reproductive success of germinating seeds across a range of different year types. We assume that it is a function of traits pertaining to growth and survival under different environmental circumstances. Such traits are assumed to result in a trade-off between reproduction in favourable and less favourable years. The model is used to explore how seed predation selects for changes in the seed bank and fecundity distribution and how changes in each of these further select for changes in the other.},

abstract = {We present an evolutionary game theory. This theory differs in several respects from current theories related to Maynard Smith's pioneering work on evolutionary stable strategies (ESS). Most current work deals with two person matrix games. For these games the strategy set is finite. We consider evolutionary games which are defined over a continuous strategy set and which permit any number of players. Matrix games are included as a bilinear continuous game. However, under our definition, such games will not posses an ESS on the interior of the strategy set. We extend previous work on continuous games by developing an ESS definition which permits the ESS to be composed of a coalition of several strategies. This definition requires that the coalition must not only be stable with respect to perturbations in strategy frequencies which comprise the coalition, but the coalition must also satisfy the requirement that no mutant strategies can invade. Ecological processes are included in the model by explicitly considering population size and density dependent selection.},

abstract = {THERE is considerable variation in the levels of herbivory experienced by woody species in ecosystems as diverse as arctic shrub tundra, boreal forests, tropical rain forests and African savannas. An important objective of evolutionary ecology is the formulation of a hypothesis that can explain this variation. One such hypothesis predicts that mature leaves of inherently slowly growing species adapted to resource-limited habitats such as infertile soil are, because of more effective chemical defences, less preferred as a food source by herbivores than mature leaves of inherently rapidly growing species adapted to productive habitats. In agreement with this prediction, we found positive correlations between the inherent growth rates of nine South African woody species and kudu and impala preferences for their mature leaves. Thus, the resource availability hypothesis of plant antiherbivore defence could explain why large African herbivores feed less on woody vegetation of dystrophic savanna-woodlands than on woody vegetation of eutrophic savannas. {\textcopyright} 1989 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {The study of elevational diversity gradients dates back to the foundation of biogeography. Although elevational patterns of plant and animal diversity have been studied for centuries, such patterns have not been reported for microorganisms and remain poorly understood. Here, in an effort to assess the generality of elevational diversity patterns, we examined soil bacterial and plant diversity along an elevation gradient. To gain insight into the forces that structure these patterns, we adopted a multifaceted approach to incorporate information about the structure, diversity, and spatial turnover of montane communities in a phylogenetic context. We found that observed patterns of plant and bacterial diversity were fundamentally different. While bacterial taxon richness and phylogenetic diversity decreased monotonically from the lowest to highest elevations, plants followed a unimodal pattern, with a peak in richness and phylogenetic diversity at mid-elevations. At all elevations bacterial communities had a tendency to be phylogenetically clustered, containing closely related taxa. In contrast, plant communities did not exhibit a uniform phylogenetic structure across the gradient: they became more overdispersed with increasing elevation, containing distantly related taxa. Finally, a metric of phylogenetic beta-diversity showed that bacterial lineages were not randomly distributed, but rather exhibited significant spatial structure across the gradient, whereas plant lineages did not exhibit a significant phylogenetic signal. Quantifying the influence of sample scale in intertaxonomic comparisons remains a challenge. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that the forces structuring microorganism and macroorganism communities along elevational gradients differ.},

abstract = {* The Metabolic Theory of Ecology has renewed interest in using energetics to scale across levels of ecological organization. Can scaling from individual phenotypes to population dynamics provides insight into why species have shifted their phenologies, abundances and distributions idiosyncratically in response to recent climate change? * We consider how the energetic implications of phenotypes may scale to understand population and species level responses to climate change using four focal grasshopper species along an elevation gradient in Colorado. We use a biophysical model to translate phenotypes and environmental conditions into estimates of body temperatures. We measure thermal tolerances and preferences and metabolic rates to assess rates of energy use and acquisition. * Body mass declines along the elevation gradient for all species, but mass-specific metabolic rates increases only modestly. We find interspecific differences in both overall thermal tolerances and preferences and in the variation of these metrics along the elevation gradient. The more dispersive species exhibit significantly higher thermal tolerance and preference consistent with much of their range spanning hot, low elevation areas. When integrating these metrics to consider metabolic constraints, we find that energetic costs decrease along the elevation gradient due to decreasing body size and temperature. Opportunities for energy acquisition, as reflected by the proportion of time that falls within a grasshopper's thermal tolerance range, peak at mid elevations. We discuss methods for translating these energetic metrics into population dynamics. * Quantifying energy balances and allocation offers a viable approach for predicting how populations will respond to climate change and the consequences for species composed of populations that may be locally adapted.},

abstract = {Models of the effects of atmospheric N deposition in forested watersheds have not adequately accounted for the effects of aquatic and near-stream processes on the concentrations and loads of NO3- in surface waters. This study compared the relative effects of aquatic and near-stream processes with those from the terrestrial ecosystem on the retention and transport of NO3- in two contrasting stream reaches of the Neversink River, a forested watershed in the Catskill Mountains of New York that receives among the highest load of atmospheric N deposition in the northeastern United States. Stream water samples were collected every two hours and ground-water and tributary samples were collected daily at base flow conditions during four 48-hour periods from April to October 1992, and NO3- mass balances were calculated for each site. Results indicated diurnal variations in stream NO3- concentrations in both reaches during all four sampling periods; this is consistent with uptake of NO3- by photoautotrophs during daylight hours. Mass-balance results revealed significant stream reach losses of NO3- at both sites during all sampling periods. The diurnal variations in NO3- concentrations and the retention of NO3- relative to terrestrial contributions to the stream reaches were greater downstream than upstream because physical factors such as the head gradients of inflowing ground water and the organic matter content of sediment are more favorable to uptake and denitrification downstream. The mass retention of NO3- increased as the mean 48-hr stream discharge increased at each site, indicating that the responsible processes are dependent on NO3- supply. Low stream temperatures during the April sampling period, however, probably reduced the rate of retention processes, resulting in smaller losses of NO3- than predicted from stream discharge alone. Water samples collected from the stream, the hyporheic zone, and the alluvial ground water at sites in both reaches indicated that the net effect of hyporheic processes on downstream NO3- transport ranged from conservative mixing to complete removal by denitrification. The relative effects of biological uptake and denitrification as retention mechanisms could not be quantified, but the results indicate that both processes are significant. These results generally confirm that aquatic and near-stream processes cause significant losses of NO3- in the Neversink River, and that the losses by these processes at downstream locations can exceed the NO3- contributions to the stream from the terrestrial environment during summer and fall base-flow conditions. Failure to consider these aquatic and near-stream processes in models of watershed response to atmospheric N deposition could result in underestimates of the amount of NO3- leaching from forested ecosystems and to an inability to unequivocally relate geographic differences in NO3- concentrations of stream waters to corresponding differences in terrestrial processes.},

Here, we estimate the amount of carbon degassed from streams and rivers in the United States using measurements of temperature, alkalinity and pH, together with high-resolution data on the morphology and surface area of these waterways. We show that streams and rivers in the US are supersaturated with carbon dioxide when compared with the atmosphere, emitting 97±32Tg carbon each year. We further show that regionally, carbon dioxide evasion from streams and rivers is positively correlated with annual precipitation, which we attribute to climatic regulation of stream surface area, and the flushing of carbon dioxide from soils. Scaling our analysis from the US to temperate rivers between 25◦ N and 50◦ N, we estimate a release of around 0.5Pg carbon to the atmosphere each year.},

abstract = {Theoretical models suggest that overlapping generations, in combination with a temporally fluctuating environment, may allow the persistence of competitors that otherwise would not coexist. Despite extensive theoretical development, this "storage effect" hypothesis has received little empirical attention. Herein I present the first explicit mathematical analysis of the contribution of the storage effect to the dynamics of competing natural populations. In Oneida Lake, NY, data collected over the past 30 years show a striking negative correlation between the water-column densities of two species of suspension-feeding zooplankton, Daphnia galeata mendotae and Daphnia pulicaria. I have demonstrated competition between these two species and have shown that both possess long-lived eggs that establish overlapping generations. Moreover, recruitment to this long-lived stage varies annually, so that both daphnids have years in which they are favored (for recruitment) relative to their competitor. When the long-term population growth rates are calculated both with and without the effects of a variable environment, I show that D. galeata mendotae clearly cannot persist without the environmental variation and prolonged dormancy (i.e., storage effect) whereas D. pulicaria persists through consistently high per capita recruitment to the long-lived stage.},

abstract = {Dormancy is a common mechanism employed by short-lived organisms for persistence in a variable environment. Theory suggests that the fraction of propagules that terminate dormancy each year should be {\textless}100{\%} when recruitment success varies tem- porally. Moreover, the fraction of propagules that resumes development should vary across habitats that differ in the probability of successful recruitment or the probability of survival during dormancy. We tested these predictions by using dormant eggs from five populations of the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia pulicaria that differ in their ability to recruit to and persist in the water column. In two separate experiments, newly produced dormant eggs were incubated in situ for one year at various sites on the bottom of the lakes. A series of reciprocal transplants among four of these populations separated the effects of lake-specific environmental cues from the genetic and maternal effects of the different populations. Additional eggs were incubated in the laboratory under photoperiod-temperature combi- nations representative of those in the field. We found that the annual hatching fraction ranged from 6{\%} to 50{\%} among lakes, and that hatching fraction was primarily driven by environmental cues rather than being a result of the source of the eggs. However, laboratory incubations demonstrated significant differences among populations in the trajectories of the hatching curves, and a much higher rate of hatching than the field incubations. Our results suggest that variation in dormancy strategies within these systems is likely influenced both by the seasonal risk experienced by the active individuals and by risks associated with entering the dormant egg bank.},

abstract = {Biocomplexity was introduced to most ecologists through the National Science Foundation's grant program, and the literature intended to introduce that program. The generalities of that literature contrast with the abstract and mathematical sophistication of literature from physics, systems theory, and indeed even of pioneering ecologists who have translated the concept into ecology. This situation leaves a middle ground, that is both accessible to ecologists in general, and cognizant of the fundamentals of complexity, to be more completely explored. To help scope this middle ground, and to promote empirical explorations that may be located there, we propose a non-exclusive framework for the conceptual territory. While recognizing the deep foundations in the studies of complex behavior, we take ecological structure as the entry point for framework development. This framework is based on a definition of biocomplexity as the degree to which ecological systems comprising biological, social and physical components incorporate spatially explicit heterogeneity, organizational connectivity, and historical contingency through time. These three dimensions of biocomplexity - heterogeneity, connectivity, and history - will be explored as axes of increasing complexity. Basing the description of spatial heterogeneity on either patch or continuous quantification, complexity of spatial structure increases as quantification moves from simple discrimination of patch types and the number of each type to assessment of configuration and the change in the mosaic through time. Organizational complexity reflects the increasing connectivity of the basic units that control system dynamics. At the simple end of the axis, the functional connectivity between units is low, and the processes within a unit are determined by structures or other processes within that unit. At the highest level of complexity along this axis, units in a mosaic interact through fluxes of energy, matter, organisms, or information, and the structure and dynamics of the mosaic can be altered by those fluxes. Temporal relationships in the system range from direct contemporary ones to indirect and historically contingent ones. The influence of indirect effects, legacies, the existence of lagged effects, and the presence of slowly appearing indirect effects constitute increasing temporal complexity. This framework embodies some features of both the structural approach to complexity and the approach of complexity of explanations that we extracted from the literature. It leaves the issue of what levels of each axis result in complex behavior as an important question for further research.},

To promote the synthesis of boundary studies across the range of environments and scales they represent, we present an inclusive scope for boundary studies. Three linked tools make the scope operative: (1) a causal framework covering all types of boundaries, (2) a model template, and (3) a strategy for constructing hypothetical models of boundary function in any ecological system. The framework focuses on flows of organisms, materials, energy, or information in heterogenous mosaics, it specifies patch contrast, identity of the flow, and nature of the boundary as the concepts to quantify in any model. The model template arranges these components in a functional form to elucidate specific boundary relationships. From the model template, working models that are system and scale specific can be developed. We exemplify the use of the linked tools of framework, model template, and working model with an experimental study of forest-field boundary function.},

We used an experimental microbial landscape to determine whether dispersal occurring at two different scales - among local communities and among metacommunities - affects diversity differently. At the local scale, dispersal initially had a positive effect and subsequently a neutral effect on diversity, whereas at the metacommunity and landscape scales, dispersal showed a consistently negative effect. The timing in which dispersal affected beta diversity also differed sharply between local communities and metacommunities. These patterns were explained by scale- and time-dependent effects of dispersal in allowing spread of species and in removing spatial refuges from predators. Our results suggest that the relative contribution of opposing mechanisms by which dispersal affects diversity changes considerably over time and space in hierarchical landscapes in which dispersal occurs at multiple scales.},

abstract = {Large-scale processes are known to be important for patterns of species richness, yet the ways in which local and larger scale processes interact is not clear. I used metacommunities consisting of five interconnected microbial aquatic communities to examine the manner in which processes at different scales affect local and metacommunity richness. Specifically, I manipulated the potential dispersal rate, whether dispersal was localized or global, and variation in initial community composition. A repeated-measures ANOVA showed that a low dispersal rate and intermediate distance dispersal enhanced local richness. Initial assembly variation had no effect on local richness, while a lack of dispersal or global dispersal reduced local richness. At the metacommunity scale, richness was enhanced throughout the time course of the experiment by initial compositional variation and was reduced by high or global dispersal. The effects of dispersal were contingent on the presence of initial compositional variation. The treatments also affected individual species occupancy patterns, with some benefiting from large-scale processes and others being adversely impacted. These results indicate that the effects of dispersal on species richness have a complex relationship with scale and are not solely divisible into "regional" vs. "local" scales. Finally, predictions of the manner in which dispersal rate structures communities appear dependent upon species compositional variation among communities.},

We hypothesized that: (1) increased basal resources should maintain greater species richness and higher predator abundance; (2) dispersal should maintain greater species richness; and (3) predation should reduce species richness, especially in the high resource treatments relative to no-predator treatments. Our results support all three hypotheses. Further, we show that dispersal affects richness at the local community scale but not at the metacommunity scale. However, predation seems to have major effects at both the local and metacommunity scale. Overall, our results show that effects of resource enrichment, dispersal, and predation were mostly additive rather than interactive, indicating that it may be sometimes easier to understand their effects than generally thought due to complex interactive effects.},

I found that immigration increased local diversity. Further, in animal studies, diversity appears maximized at intermediate dispersal rates but not with plant studies; however, more standardized studies are needed. Finally, results are ambiguous as to what happens at larger scales, with studies finding either declines or no change in regional diversity with dispersal. Taken together, these results reveal that dispersal has a complex, spatially contingent relationship with patterns of species diversity.},

It forms one explanation of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) for local communities--specifically that diversity should be maximized at intermediate disturbance frequencies, yet only a fraction of empirical studies support IDH predictions. Similarly, this trade-off is also a powerful explanation of coexistence at larger spatial scales. I show, with a microbial experimental system, that the diversity-disturbance relationship is dependent on the relative distribution of species along this trade-off. Here I show that, when species are skewed toward late-successional habits, local diversity declines with disturbance. Yet, despite this trait skew, diversity at scales larger than the patch appears insensitive to the trade-off distribution. Intermediate disturbance frequencies produce the greatest diversity in patch successional stage, thus benefiting the maximum number of species at larger scales.},

abstract = {Although populations of amphibians are declining worldwide, there is no evidence that salamanders occupying small streams are experiencing enigmatic declines, and populations of these species seem stable. Theory predicts that dispersal through multiple pathways can stabilize populations, preventing extinction in habitat networks. However, empirical data to support this prediction are absent for most species, especially those at risk of decline. Our mark-recapture study of stream salamanders reveals both a strong upstream bias in dispersal and a surprisingly high rate of overland dispersal to adjacent headwater streams. This evidence of route-dependent variation in dispersal rates suggests a spatial mechanism for population stability in headwater-stream salamanders. Our results link the movement behavior of stream salamanders to network topology, and they underscore the importance of identifying and protecting critical dispersal pathways when addressing region-wide population declines.},

abstract = {1. Both local and regional processes simultaneously control species assemblages depending on spatial habitat configuration. In dendritic networks like streams, the unique spatial arrangement of habitats produces various combinations of local habitat size and isolation. Stream invertebrate assemblages could therefore be controlled by different combinations of local and regional processes, depending on their location in the network. 2. Using quantile regression, we investigated how local habitat size, local environmental conditions and spatial isolation influenced variation in assemblage composition. Adult Trichoptera and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were represented by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination scores, as were local environmental conditions, in four headwater stream networks in New Zealand. 3. With increasing local habitat size, there was a decrease in variation in assemblage composition (NMDS scores) of both adult Trichoptera and benthic macroinvertebrates. This relationship between habitat size and assemblage variation was related to local habitat conditions at the upper limit of assemblage variability and spatial isolation at the lower limit of assemblage variability, for both adult Trichoptera and benthic assemblages, indicating joint local and regional controls on stream invertebrate assemblages. 4. The relationships between local assemblages and their neighbours, based on community similarity scores, differed between benthic macroinvertebrates and adult Trichoptera. For benthic assemblages, the larger the stream, the more similar assemblages were to neighbouring assemblages, whereas there was no consistent relationship between assemblage similarity and stream size for adult Trichoptera. This difference in structuring could be attributed to contrasting spatial influences linked to the different dispersal modes of adults and larvae. However, because adult and benthic assemblages are not independent, the influence of life stage on spatial distribution is difficult to determine (i.e. it is essentially a ‘chicken and egg' argument). 5. Overall, our approach using quantile regression to evaluate limit responses, rather than regressions on means, has highlighted the joint importance of local habitat and spatial processes in structuring stream invertebrate assemblages. Furthermore, we have provided evidence for the importance of the spatial network arrangement and interactions between life stages and dispersal processes, in structuring stream assemblages.},

Their characteristics are defined by both large-scale spatial processes such as dispersal, and local environmental processes, although which factors are likely to predominate in a given situation is poorly understood.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nObjectives We investigated whether flow regime at the network-scale helped explain the relative importance of spatial and local-environmental processes in structuring stream metacommunities.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMethods Spatial sampling of stream macroinvertebrates was carried out in stream networks in New Zealand. Local environmental variables were also measured throughout the stream networks, while hydrographs were modelled and calibrated with field measurements.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nResults Significant associations with both spatial and local-environmental predictor variables were found, consistent with several metacommunity types. In particular, two measures of flow regime were associated with different metacommunity types. Thus, stream networks characterised by a period of stability just before sampling, and networks sampled after a long period of instability, had more significant spatial structuring of metacommunities than those of intermediate flow stability. The importance of spatial processes in structuring the network metacommunities also increased with time since the last community-resetting flow. Our results therefore suggested that metacommunity type depended on the flow regime. Dispersal traits and network topology also helped explain some of the variation among the metacommunities.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nConclusions Overall, our findings conform to theoretical predictions related to dispersal limitation and topology, and indicate that metacommunity models need to be dynamic to capture processes in both space and time.},

Here we report the next stage in this coevolutionary arms race, using the Illumina GAIIx platform to sequence a diverse array of 25 environmental samples and three known "mock communities" at a depth averaging 3.1 million reads per sample. We demonstrate excellent consistency in taxonomic recovery and recapture diversity patterns that were previously reported on the basis of metaanalysis of many studies from the literature (notably, the saline/nonsaline split in environmental samples and the split between host-associated and free-living communities). We also demonstrate that 2,000 Illumina single-end reads are sufficient to recapture the same relationships among samples that we observe with the full dataset. The results thus open up the possibility of conducting large-scale studies analyzing thousands of samples simultaneously to survey microbial communities at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.},

abstract = {The hyporheic zone, defined by shallow subsurface pathways through river beds and banks beginning and ending at the river, is an integral and unique component of fluvial systems. It hosts myriad hydrologically controlled processes that are potentially coupled in complex ways. Understanding these processes and the connections between them is critical since these processes are not only important locally but integrate to impact increasingly larger scale biogeochemical functioning of the river corridor up to the river network scale. Thus, the hyporheic zone continues to be a growing research focus for many hydrologists for more than half the history of Water Resources Research. This manuscript partly summarizes the historical development of hyporheic zone hydrologic science as gleaned from papers published in Water Resources Research, from the birth of the concept of the hyporheic zone as a hydrologic black box (sometimes referred to as transient storage zone), to its adolescent years of being torn between occasionally competing research perspectives of interrogating the hyporheic zone from a surface or subsurface view, to its mature emergence as an interdisciplinary research field that employs the wide array of state-of-the-art tools available to the modern hydrologist. The field is vibrant and moving in the right direction of addressing critical fundamental and applied questions with no clear end in sight in its growth. There are exciting opportunities for scientists that are able to tightly link the allied fields of geology, geomorphology, hydrology, geochemistry, and ecology to tackle the many open problems in hyporheic zone science.},

abstract = {Excessive nutrient loading of water bodies is a leading cause of water pollution worldwide, and controlling nutrient levels in watersheds is a primary objective of most environmental policy. Over the past two decades, much research has shown that ecosystems with more species are more efficient at removing nutrients from soil and water than are ecosystems with fewer species. This has led some to suggest that conservation of biodiversity might be a useful tool for managing nutrient uptake and storage, but this suggestion has been controversial, in part because the specific biological mechanisms by which species diversity influences nutrient uptake have not been identified. Here I use a model system of stream biofilms to show that niche partitioning among species of algae can increase the uptake and storage of nitrate, a nutrient pollutant of global concern. I manipulated the number of species of algae growing in the biofilms of 150 stream mesocosms that had been set up to mimic the variety of flow habitats and disturbance regimes that are typical of natural streams. Nitrogen uptake rates, as measured by using (15)N-labelled nitrate, increased linearly with species richness and were driven by niche differences among species. As different forms of algae came to dominate each unique habitat in a stream, the more diverse communities achieved a higher biomass and greater (15)N uptake. When these niche opportunities were experimentally removed by making all of the habitats in a stream uniform, diversity did not influence nitrogen uptake, and biofilms collapsed to a single dominant species. These results provide direct evidence that communities with more species take greater advantage of the niche opportunities in an environment, and this allows diverse systems to capture a greater proportion of biologically available resources such as nitrogen. One implication is that biodiversity may help to buffer natural ecosystems against the ecological impacts of nutrient pollution.},

Three kinds of dynamic models were used to estimate allochthony: a process-rich, dual-isotope flow model based on mass bal- ances of two carbon isotopes in 12 carbon pools; simple univariate time-series models driven by observed time courses of d 13 CO 2 ; and multivariate autoregression models that combined information from time series of d 13 C in several interacting carbon pools. All three models gave similar estimates of allochthony. In the three experiments without nutrient enrichment, flows of terrestrial carbon to dissolved and particulate organic carbon, zoo- plankton, Chaoborus , and fishes were substantial. For example, terrestrial sources accounted for more than half the carbon flow to juvenile and adult largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, golden shiners, brook sticklebacks, and fathead minnows in the unenriched ex- periments. Allochthony was highest in the dystrophic lake and lowest in the nutrient- enriched lake. Nutrient enrichment of Peter Lake decreased allochthony of zooplankton from 0.34–0.48 to 0–0.12, and of fishes from 0.51–0.80 to 0.25–0.55. These experiments show that lake ecosystem carbon cycles, including carbon flows to consumers, are heavily subsidized by organic carbon from the surrounding landscape.},

A forward-looking ecology, which assesses a broad range of possible future ecosystem states, is the complement of long-term, historical approaches to ecology. Together they are the ecology of the long now. The "long now" of ecosystems includes historical influences that shape present ecologies, and the future consequences of present events. As a step in testing theories by their consequences, prediction is widely used in ecology. Ecologists have developed, criticized, and improved many predictive theories. Ecologists also have developed many empirical relationships that are potentially useful in forecasting. Eutrophication is an example of a problem for which ecologists created fundamental understanding, predictive capability, and new options for management. Ecologists frequently justify their research funding through appeals to improved predictability. This goal is sometimes attainable and in any case motivates a considerable body of insightful research. However, in many cases of environmental decision making, what ecologists cannot predict is at least as important as what can be predicted. It is important to assess the full range of changes in ecosystems that may plausibly occur in the future, and the implications of these changes. The paper discusses some ways that ecological information can be used to improve understanding of the future consequences of present choices},

abstract = {Responses of zooplankton, pelagic primary producers, planktonic bacteria, and CO2 exchange with the atmosphere were measured in four lakes with contrasting food webs under a range of nutrient enrichments during a seven-year period, Prior to enrichment, food webs were manipulated to create contrasts between piscivore dominance and planktivore dominance. Nutrient enrichments of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus exhibited ratios of N:P {\textgreater} 17:1, by atoms, to maintain P limitation. An unmanipulated reference lake, Paul Lake, revealed baseline variability but showed no trends that could confound the interpretation of changes in the nearby manipulated lakes. Herbivorous zooplankton of West Long Lake (piscivorous fishes) were large-bodied Daphnia spp., in contrast to the small-bodied grazers that predominated in Peter Lake (planktivorous fishes). At comparable levels of nutrient enrichment, Peter Lake's areal chlorophyll and areal primary production rates exceeded those of West Long Lake by factors of approximately three and six, respectively. Grazers suppressed pelagic primary producers in West Long Lake, relative to Peter Lake, even when nutrient input rates were so high that soluble reactive phosphorus accumulated in the epilimnions of both lakes during summer. Peter Lake also had higher bacterial production (but not biomass) than West Long Lake. Hydrologic changes that accompanied manipulation of East Long Lake caused concentrations of colored dissolved organic carbon to increase, leading to considerable variability in fish and zooplankton populations. Both trophic cascades and water color appeared to inhibit the response of primary producers to nutrients in East Long Lake. Carbon dioxide was discharged to the atmosphere by Paul Lake in all years and by the other lakes prior to nutrient addition. During nutrient addition, only Peter Lake consistently absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere, due to high rates of carbon fixation by primary producers. In contrast, CO2 concentrations of West Long Lake shifted to near-atmospheric levels, and net fluxes were near zero, while East Long Lake continued to discharge CO2 to the atmosphere.},

abstract = {Biological communities often occur in spatially structured habitats where connectivity directly affects dispersal and metacommunity processes. Recent theoretical work suggests that dispersal constrained by the connectivity of specific habitat structures, such as dendrites like river networks, can explain observed features of biodiversity, but direct evidence is still lacking. We experimentally show that connectivity per se shapes diversity patterns in microcosm metacommunities at different levels. Local dispersal in isotropic lattice landscapes homogenizes local species richness and leads to pronounced spatial persistence. On the contrary, dispersal along dendritic landscapes leads to higher variability in local diversity and among-community composition. Although headwaters exhibit relatively lower species richness, they are crucial for the maintenance of regional biodiversity. Our results establish that spatially constrained dendritic connectivity is a key factor for community composition and population persistence.},

Located on the surface of the spore, the coat provides resistance to potentially toxic molecules as well as to predation by the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila. When coat-defective spores are fed to Tetrahymena, the spores are readily digested. However, a residue termed a "rind" that looks like coat material remains. As observed with a phase-contrast microscope, the rinds are spherical or hemispherical structures that appear to be devoid of internal contents. Atomic force microscopy and chemical analyses showed that (i) the rinds are composed of insoluble protein largely derived from both outer and inner spore coat layers, (ii) the amorphous layer of the outer coat is largely responsible for providing spore resistance to protozoal digestion, and (iii) the rinds and intact spores do not contain significant levels of silicon.},

abstract = {Darwin viewed species range limits as chiefly determined by an interplay between the abiotic environment and interspecific interactions. Haldane argued that species' ranges could be set in- traspecifically when gene flow from a species' populous center over- whelms local adaptation at the periphery. Recently, Kirkpatrick and Barton have modeled Haldane's process with a quantitative genetic model that combines density-dependent local population growth with dispersal and gene flow across a linear environmental gradient in optimum phenotype. To address Darwin's ideas, we have extended the Kirkpatrick and Barton model to include interspecific compe- tition and the frequency-dependent selection that it generates, as well as stabilizing selection on a quantitative character. Our model in- cludes local population growth, movements over space, natural se- lection, and gene flow. It simultaneously addresses the evolution of character displacement and species borders. It reproduces the Kirk- patrick and Barton single-species result that limited ranges can be produced with sufficiently steep environmental gradients and strong dispersal. Further, in the absence of environmental gradients or bar- riers to dispersal, interspecific competition will not limit species ranges at evolutionary equilibrium. However, interspecific compe- tition can interact with environmental gradients and gene flow to generate limited ranges with much less extreme gradient and dispersal parameters than in the single-species case. Species display character displacement in sympatry, yet the reduction in competition that re- sults fromthis displacement does not necessarily allow the two species to become sympatric everywhere. When species meet, competition reduces population densities in the region of overlap, which, in turn, intensifies the asymmetry in gene flow from center to margin. This reduces the ability of each species to adapt to local physical conditions at their range limits. If environmental gradients are monotonic but not linear, the transition zone between species at coevolutionary equilibrium occurs where the environmental gradient is steepest. If productivity gradients are also introduced into the model, then patterns similar to Rapoport's rule emerge. Interacting species respond to climate change, as it affects the optimal phenotype over space, by a combination of range shifts and local evolution in mean phenotype, while solitary species respond solely by range shifts. Finally, we com- pare empirical estimates for intrinsic growth rates and diffusion co- efficients for several species to those needed by the single-species model to produce a stable limited range. These empirical values are generally insufficient to produce limited ranges in the model sug- gesting a role for interspecific interactions.},

As long as an interior equilibrium point is feasible for pure exploitation systems, it is globally stable. If the interior equilibrium point is unfeasible, there will be only one globally stable subset of species from the total species pool. Under most parameter conditions one fixed equilibrium point will be globally stable. Under very rare conditions, a boundary species subset may exist at a set of neutrally stable equilibrium points. When interspecific interference and/or mutualism are also present the above results may not hold, unless these interactions are directed and balanced in a very precise fashion. Feasible equilibrium points may be unstable and multiple domains of attraction may exist. That is, there may be a number of alternative stable equilibrium communities which may develop in a given area and the final outcome may depend solely on historical factors such as the sequences and numbers in which each species colonizes.},

We explore a number of models of interspecific interactions that lead to (sometimes abrupt) distribution limits in the presence and absence of environmental gradients.We find that gradients in competitive ability can lead to spatial segregation of competitors into distinct ranges, but that spatial movement tends to broaden the region of sympatry between the two species, and that Allee effects tend to sharpen these boundaries. We generalize these simple models to include metapopulation dynamics and other types of interactions including predator-prey and host-parasite interactions. We derive conditions for range limits in each case.We also consider models that include coevolution and gene flow and find that character displacement along environmental gradients can lead to stable parapatric distributions. We conclude that it is essential to consider coevolved species interactions as a potential mechanism limiting species distributions, particularly when barriers to dispersal are weak and environmental gradients are gradual.},

@article{Caswell1978,
abstract = {There is now convincing evidence, from a variety of ecological systems, that predation is capable of maintaining coexistence among a set of competing prey species, some of which would be excluded in its absence. This interaction has been suggested as a major factor determining the structure of some communities, but attempts to incorporate it into the mathematical framework of population theory have been frustrating. Although the possibility of predator-mediated coexistence is easily shown, parameter-space studies of simple three-species models suggest that it is an improbable occurrence, requiring a very delicate balancing of parameter values. To attack this problem, I classify population systems as open or closed, and equilibrium or nonequilibrium. Closed systems consist of a single homogeneous patch of habitat; open systems, in their simplest form, are a collection of such patches (or cells) connected by migration. Equilibrium theories are restricted to behavior at or near an equilibrium point, while nonequilibrium theories explicitly consider the transient behavior of the system. Almost all of the work on predator-mediated coexistence has been limited to closed, equilibrium systems. In such studies conditions are sought which guarantee that predation results in a stable equilibrium at which all species are present. A general property of open systems is that transient, nonequilibrium behaviors may persist for extremely long periods of time. A model is presented which uses this fact to generate long-term, but nonequilibrial, coexistence among competitors under the impact of predation. The model is a discrete, or logical, model, in which presence and absence of each of two competitors and a predator is followed in a set of stochastically connected local population cells. The predator acts to open up new cells for nonequilibrium growth of the prey species. All forms of predator-mediated coexistence other than the open-system, nonequilibrium effect were purposely eliminated from the model. The results of the model clearly demonstrate the possibility of long-term predator-mediated coexistence in such a system. In spite of stacking the deck against it, the positive effect of the predator on coexistence is statistically highly significant. Moreover, a crude evolutionary analysis suggests that the effect is not only possible, but probable. These results can be generalized far beyond the highly abstracted framework of the model. Such generalizations suggest that this phenomenon may be of major importance in natural systems. The predictions of the model can be tested against the real world in several ways. First, it predicts the possibility of predator-mediated coexistence, which agrees with the numerous observations of that phenomenon. More importantly, it makes predictions (concerning the spatial and temporal organization of the predation process) that distinguish it from the other modes of predator-mediated coexistence. These predictions are corroborated by observations of a number of cases where predation has failed to generate coexistence. The distinction between closed and open, equilibrium and nonequilibrium, population systems has an important impact on the form and substance of ecological theory.},

abstract = {The relation of community structure to community function is the subject of much ecological theorizing. Three approaches to the problem, based on cybernetics, control theory, and niche theory, can be identified. They concur in giving biological interactions a major role in the determination of community structure in general, and species diversity in particular. To examine this body of theory, I use a "neutral" model for community development, a model which eliminates completely the biological interactions in question. Comparison of the patterns of community structure resulting from this model with the structure of natural communities provides an estimate of the effect of the biotic interactions. This can then be compared to the theoretically predicted effects. The neutral model used was originally developed in population genetics. In the context in which it is used here, it describes the stochastic development of a set of noninteracting populations, which colonize a community, persist temporarily, and eventually become extinct. The model predicts the form of the distribution of relative abundances and of species area curves, and sample values of species diversity. Comparisons of the model's predictions with actual community structure are made across what are taken to be gradients in the importance of biological interaction (successional vs. climax communities, high variation vs. low variation environments, the temperate zone vs. the tropics), using data on birds, fish, trees and insects. The results clearly contradict some of the theories of community structure. In those situations where biological interactions are predicted to generate the greatest increase in species diversity, the neutral model analysis shows that diversity is in fact significantly lower than would be expected in the absence of such interactions. Some implications of these findings for community theory are discussed. See full-text article at JSTOR},

We show that, regardless of the functional form of density dependence, the sensitivity of lambda is equal to the sensitivity of an effective equilibrium density (N) over tilde, which is a weighted combination of the equilibrium stage densities. The weights measure the contributions of each stage to density dependence and their effects on demography. Thus, (N) over tilde is in general more relevant than total density, which simply adds all stages regardless of their ecological properties. As log lambda is the invasion exponent, our results show that successful invasion will increase (N) over tilde, and that an evolutionary stable strategy will maximize (N) over tilde. Our results imply that eigenvalue sensitivity analysis of a population projection matrix that is evaluated near equilibrium can give useful information about the sensitivity of the equilibrium population, even if no data on density dependence are available.},

The relationship with TP was improved somewhat when periphyton biomass was estimated as cell volume rather than as chlorophyll or organic material. When the community was divided among various groups according to taxa, life form, and size, only the biomasses of greens, filamentous algae, and algae exceeding 10000 .mu.m were correlated with TP. The biomass of the smaller algae, which are more readily grazed by benthos, was about the same in all lakes whereas nuisance forms increased significantly with P enrichment. At more eutrophic sites, maximal periphyton biomasses were observed in midsummer, coinciding with peak recreational use of lakes, whereas at the other sites, maxima appeared earlier in the season.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of phylogenetic data, computing power and informatics tools has facilitated a rapid expansion of studies that apply phylogenetic data and methods to community ecology. Several key areas are reviewed in which phylogenetic information helps to resolve long-standing controversies in community ecology, challenges previous assumptions, and opens new areas of investigation. In particular, studies in phylogenetic community ecology have helped to reveal the multitude of processes driving community assembly and have demonstrated the importance of evolution in the assembly process. Phylogenetic approaches have also increased understanding of the consequences of community interactions for speciation, adaptation and extinction. Finally, phylogenetic community structure and composition holds promise for predicting ecosystem processes and impacts of global change. Major challenges to advancing these areas remain. In particular, determining the extent to which ecologically relevant traits are phylogenetically conserved or convergent, and over what temporal scale, is critical to understanding the causes of community phylogenetic structure and its evolutionary and ecosystem consequences. Harnessing phylogenetic information to understand and forecast changes in diversity and dynamics of communities is a critical step in managing and restoring the Earth's biota in a time of rapid global change.},

abstract = {The statistical framework of rarefaction curves and asymptotic estimators allows for an effective standardization of biodiversity measures. However, most statistical analyses still consist of point comparisons of diversity estimators for a particular sampling level. We introduce new randomization methods that incorporate sampling variability encompassing the entire length of the rarefaction curve and allow for statistical comparison of i ≥2 individual-based, sample-based, or coverage-based rarefaction curves. These methods distinguish between two distinct null hypotheses: the ecological null hypothesis (H0eco) and the biogeographical null hypothesis (H0biog). H0eco states that the i samples were drawn from a single assemblage, and any differences among them in species richness, composition, or relative abundance reflect only sampling effects. H0biog states that the i samples were drawn from assemblages that differ in their species composition but share similar species richness and species abundance distributions. To test H0eco, we created a composite rarefaction curve by summing the abundances of all species from the i samples. We then calculated a test statistic Zeco, the (cumulative) summed areas of difference between each of the i individual curves and the composite curve. For H0biog, the test statistic Zbiog was calculated by summing the area of difference between all possible pairs of the i individual curves. Bootstrap sampling from the composite curve (H0eco) or random sampling from different simulated assemblages using alternative abundance distributions (H0biog) was used to create the null distribution of Z, and to provide a frequentist test of Z?|?H0. Rejection of H0eco does not pinpoint whether the samples differ in species richness, species composition, and/or relative abundance. In benchmark comparisons, both tests performed satisfactorily against artificial data sets randomly drawn from a single assemblage (low Type I error). In benchmark comparisons with different species abundance distributions and richness, the tests had adequate power to detect differences among curves (low Type II error), although power diminished at small sample sizes and for small differences among underlying species rank abundances.},

abstract = {Describing the relative magnitude and controls of herbivory and decomposition is important in understanding the trophic transference, recycling, and storage of carbon and nutrients in diverse ecosystems. We examine the variability in herbivory and decomposition between and within a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We also analyze how that variability is associated with differences in net primary production and producer nutritional quality. Net primary production and producer nutritional quality are uncorrelated between the two types of system or within either type. Producer nutritional quality is correlated to the percentage of primary production consumed by herbivores or percentage of detrital production decomposed annually, regardless of whether the comparison is made between the two types of systems or within either type of system. Thus, producer nutritional quality stands out as a consistent indicator of the importance of consumers as top-down controls of producer biomass and detritus accumulation and nutrient recycling. However, absolute consumption by herbivores and absolute decomposition (both in g C{\&}{\#}183;m{\&}{\#}8722;2{\&}{\#}183;yr{\&}{\#}8722;1) are often associated with absolute primary production and independent of producer nutritional quality, because the variability in net primary production across systems largely exceeds that in the percentage consumed or decomposed. Thus, primary production often stands out as an indicator of the absolute flux of producer carbon transferred to consumers and of the potential levels of secondary production maintained in the system. These patterns contribute to our understanding of the variability and control of herbivory and decomposition, and implications on carbon and nutrient cycling, in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Furthermore, in view of their robustness, they may offer a template for global change models seeking to predict anthropogenic effects on carbon and nutrient fluxes.},

abstract = {Quantifying and assessing changes in biological diversity are central aspects of many ecological studies, yet accurate methods of estimating biological diversity from sampling data have been elusive. Hill numbers, or the effective number of species, are increasingly used to characterize the taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional diversity of an assemblage. However, empirical estimates of Hill numbers, including species richness, tend to be an increasing function of sampling effort and, thus, tend to increase with sample completeness. Integrated curves based on sampling theory that smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation) standardize samples on the basis of sample size or sample completeness and facilitate the comparison of biodiversity data. Here we extended previous rarefaction and extrapolation models for species richness (Hill number qD, where q = 0) to measures of taxon diversity incorporating relative abundance (i.e., for any Hill number qD, q {\textgreater} 0) and present a unified approach for both individual-based (abundance) data and samplebased (incidence) data. Using this unified sampling framework, we derive both theoretical formulas and analytic estimators for seamless rarefaction and extrapolation based on Hill numbers. Detailed examples are provided for the first three Hill numbers: q = 0 (species richness), q = 1 (the exponential of Shannon's entropy index), and q = 2 (the inverse of Simpson's concentration index). We developed a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around Hill numbers, facilitating the comparison of multiple assemblages of both rarefied and extrapolated samples. The proposed estimators are accurate for both rarefaction and short-range extrapolation. For long-range extrapolation, the performance of the estimators depends on both the value of q and on the extrapolation range. We tested our methods on simulated data generated from species abundance models and on data from large species inventories. We also illustrate the formulas and estimators using empirical data sets from biodiversity surveys of temperate forest spiders and tropical ants. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {In the present paper, the annual spawning migration of adults is introduced into a model, describing the Salmo trutta population dynamics in a hierarchically organized river network (four levels and 15 interconnected patches) model based on previous work. The model describes simultaneously demographic and migration processes taking place at different time scales: migrations of individuals between patches at a fast time scale (e.g. the week or the month), the annual spawning migration of adults and the demography at the slow time scale of the year. The S. trutta population is sub-divided into three age-classes (young of the year, juveniles, and adults). We used a Leslie-type model, coupled with a migration matrix associated with the annual spawning process, and a second migration matrix associated with fast movements of individuals between patches throughout the year. All demographic and migratory parameters are constant, leading to a linear model governing 45 state variables (15 patchesxthree age-classes). By taking advantage of the two time scales and using aggregation techniques for the case of discrete time models, the complete model was approximated by a reduced one, with only three global variables (one per age-class) evolving at the slow time scale. Demographic indices were calculated for the population, and a sensibility analysis was performed to detect which parameters influence the most model predictions. We also quantified how modifications of the river network structure, by channels (change in connections between patches) or dams (patch deletion), influence the global population dynamics. We checked that the strategy of annual spawning migrations is actually beneficial for the population (the asymptotic population growth rate is increased), and that dams may have a more detrimental effect on the whole population dynamics than channelling.},

Here, I consider how life-history plasticity within a single species can influence the outcome of food web interactions along a productivity gradient. An individual can either reproduce early but remain susceptible to predators throughout its life (strategy 1) or delay reproduction and grow to a predator-invulnerable size refuge (strategy 2). At low productivity, strategy 1 is favored because the probability of growing to a size refuge is low compared to the probability of being eaten. Here, the system is consumer controlled, and predators have large effects on the food web. At high productivity, strategy 2 is favored because high food availability increases the probability of prey attaining size refuge before being eaten. Consequently, the system becomes less consumer controlled, and predators have weaker effects on food web dynamics. At intermediate productivity, either strategy 1 or strategy 2 can be favored, depending on the initial conditions of the system. Field and laboratory experiments with a common freshwater snail Helisoma trivolis and its insect predator Belostoma flumineum support both the key assumptions and predictions of the models.},

abstract = {The included niche is a situation where one species' niche is included within that of a more generalized species. The species whose niche is included must be a superior competitor for the shared resources on a per capita basis in order ro coexist. In addition to per capita effects that one species has on the other for shared resources, the overall competitive effect a generalist can have on a specialist is determined by the density that it can maintain on exclusive resources while still having a consumptive effect on the shared resources. This 'numerical effect' occurs independently of the per capita effects for the shared resources. Thus, coexistence and the relative abundances of species within an included niche depend upon per capita effects of both species for the shared resources and the ratio of exclusive:shared resources available to the generalist. I examined the dynamics of two grass-feeding grasshoppers, the larger, Arphia pseudoneitana, and the smaller Trachyrhachys kiowa, whose feeding niches were included within that of the generalist, Melanoplus sanguinipes. While both specialists were better competitors for the shared resources than was M. sanguinipes, their overall competitive effects were different. When M. sanguinipes was with T. kiowa, its exclusive resources consisted of forbs as well as a proportion of grasses. By having a relatively high carrying capacity on exclusive resources, M. sanguinipes was able to exert a greater overall competitive effect on T. kiowa than the reverse. When M. sanguinipes was with A. pseudoneitana. its exclusive resources consisted of only forbs, such that M. sanguinipes exhibited a smaller overall effect on A. pseudoneitana than the reverse.},

abstract = {I experimentally examined the relative importance of a top predator in a three trophic level food chain in which the abiotic conditions were varied. Food chains consisting of plants, grasshoppers and wolf spiders were established in field cages placed over natural prairie. Grasshopper resource intake was manipulated by altering the abiotic environment (i.e., shading during peak grasshopper feeding times to reduce temperature and radiation), and thus the time they had available for feeding. Grasshoppers in control (unshaded) food chains compensated for spider predation by increased per capita survival and food consumption by those remaining. In this scenario, plant biomass was unaffected by the presence of spiders (i.e., no trophic cascade). However, when the grasshoppers were shaded for the morning hours, reducing their time available for feeding, spiders{\&}apos; reduced grasshopper density, and the abundance of plants increased relative to when spiders were absent (i.e., a trophic cascade). This experiment showed that by simply altering the abiotic environment such that grasshopper foraging ability changed, profound differences in the impacts of top predators resulted},

abstract = {Historically, the biodiversity and composition of species in a locality was thought to be influenced primarily by deterministic factors. In such cases, species' niches create differential responses to environmental conditions and interspecific interactions, which combine to determine that locality's biodiversity and species composition. More recently, proponents of the neutral theory have placed a premium on how stochastic factors, such as birth, death, colonization, and extinction (termed "ecological drift") influence diversity and species composition in a locality independent of their niches. Here, I develop the hypothesis that the relative importance of stochastic ecological drift and/or priority effects depend on the harshness of the ecological filter in those habitats. I established long-term experimental ponds to explore the relative importance of community assembly history and drought on patterns of community compositional similarity among ponds that were otherwise similar in their environmental conditions. I show considerable site-to-site variation in pond community composition in the absence of drought that likely resulted from a combination of stochastic ecological drift and priority effects. However, in ponds that experienced drought, I found much higher similarity among communities that likely resulted from niche-selection filtering out species from the regional pool that could not tolerate such environmental harshness. These results implicate the critical role for understanding the processes of community assembly when examining patterns of biodiversity at different spatial scales.},

abstract = {Community assembly provides a conceptual foundation for understanding the processes that determine which and how many species live in a particular locality. Evidence suggests that community assembly often leads to a single stable equilibrium, such that the conditions of the environment and interspecific interactions determine which species will exist there. In such cases, regions of local communities with similar environmental conditions should have similar community composition. Other evidence suggests that community assembly can lead to multiple stable equilibria. Thus, the resulting community depends on the assembly history, even when all species have access to the community. In these cases, a region of local communities with similar environmental conditions can be very dissimilar in their community composition. Both regional and local factors should determine the patterns by which communities assemble, and the resultant degree of similarity or dissimilarity among localities with similar environments. A single equilibrium in more likely to be realized in systems with small regional species pools, high rates of connectance, low productivity and high disturbance. Multiple stable equilibria are more likely in systems with large regional species pools, low rates of connectance, high productivity and low disturbance. I illustrate preliminary evidence for these predictions from an observational study of small pond communities, and show important effects on community similarity, as well as on local and regional species richness.},

abstract = {This review discusses the interface between two of the most important types of interactions between species, interspecific competition and predation. Predation has been claimed to increase, decrease, or have little effect on, the strength, impact or importance of interspecific competition. There is confusion about both the meaning of these terms and the likelihood of, and conditions required for, each of these outcomes. In this article we distinguish among three measures of the influence of predation on competitive outcomes: short-term per capita consumption or growth rates, long-term changes in density, and the probability of competitive coexistence. We then outline various theoretical mechanisms that can lead to qualitatively distinct effects of predators. The qualitative effect of predators can depend both on the mechanism of competition and on the definition of competitive strength/impact. In assessing the empirical literature, we ask: (1) What definitions of competitive strength/impact have been assumed? (2) Does strong evidence exist to support one or more of the possible mechanisms that can produce a given outcome? (3) Do biases in the choice of organism or manipulation exist, and are they likely to have influenced the conclusions reached? We conclude by discussing several unanswered questions, and espouse a stronger interchange between empirical and theoretical approaches to this important question.},

abstract = {The diversity of life is heterogeneously distributed across the Earth. A primary cause for this pattern is the heterogeneity in the amount of energy, or primary productivity (the rate of carbon fixed through photosynthesis), available to the biota in a given location. But the shape of the relationship between productivity and species diversity is highly variable. In many cases, the relationship is 'hump-shaped', where diversity peaks at intermediate productivity. In other cases, diversity increases linearly with productivity. A possible reason for this discrepancy is that data are often collected at different spatial scales. If the mechanisms that determine species diversity vary with spatial scale, then so would the shape of the productivity-diversity relationship. Here, we present evidence for scale-dependent productivity-diversity patterns in ponds. When the data were viewed at a local scale (among ponds), the relationship was hump-shaped, whereas when the same data were viewed at a regional scale (among watersheds), the relationship was positively linear. This dependence on scale results because dissimilarity in local species composition within regions increased with productivity.},

In this paper, we present a series of models comparing community level outcomes when plants either resist or tolerate herbivory. We show that resistance and tolerance can lead to very different outcomes. A particularly important result is that resistant species should often coexist locally with other, less resistant competitors, whereas tolerant species should not be able to coexist locally with less tolerant competitors, although priority effects allow them to coexist regionally. We also use these models to suggest some insights into the evolution of these traits within more complex communities. We emphasize how understanding the differential effects of plant tolerance and resistance in food webs provides greater appreciation of a variety of empirical patterns that heretofore have appeared enigmatic.},

abstract = {Empirical results concerning a freshwater snail community are interpreted using a two-species consumer model that incorporates resource structure. Behavioural-scale measurements on a guild of five species of freshwater pond snails (Mollusca: Pulmonata) indicate a trade-off between the ability to utilize a patch's resource and the ability to quickly find new resource patches. Community-level experiments demonstrate that both species richness and composition are affected by the patchiness of the environment. In particular, treatments with low patchiness are dominated by species best at exploiting local resources (diggers) whereas treatments with high patchiness are dominated by species best at finding new patches (grazers). Results from a controlled mesocosm experiment with two of the most common of these species, Helisoma trivolvis (a relative digger) and Physella gyrina (Physidae) (a relative grazer) show that the patchiness of the environment strongly influences the outcomes of interspecific competition among these two species: the digger performed much better in less patchy habitats, whereas the grazer performed better in more patchy habitats. A two-species model of diggers and grazers modified to incorporate behavioural aspects of patchiness produces this same pattern of competitive outcomes.},

A selective overview of the empirical evidence for and against this theory is provided, with a special emphasis on tropical plant communities. The neutral theory predicts many of the basic patterns of biodiversity, confirming its heuristic power. The strict assumption of equivalence that defines neutrality, equivalence among individuals, finds little empirical support in general. However, a weaker assumption holds for stable communities, the equivalence of average fitness among species. One reason for the surprising success of the neutral theory is that all the theories of species coexistence satisfying the fitness equivalence assumption, including many theories of niche differentiation, generate exactly the same patterns as the neutral theory. Hubbell's neutral theory represents an important synthesis and a much needed demonstration of the pivotal role of intraspecific variability in ecology. Further improvements should lead to an explicit linking to niche-based processes. This research programme will depend crucially on forthcoming theoretical and empirical achievements.},

Evolutionary theory postulates that the loss or death of propagules during dispersal episodes (cost of dispersal) should select against dispersal. The cost of dispersal is expected to be a strong selective force in fragmented habitats. We analyzed patchy populations of the weed Crepis sancta occupying small patches on sidewalks, around trees planted within the city of Montpellier (South of France), to investigate the recent evolutionary consequences of the cost of dispersal. C. sancta produces both dispersing and nondispersing seeds. First, we showed that, in urban patches, dispersing seeds have a 55{\%} lower chance of settling in their patch compared with nondispersing seeds and, thus, fall on a concrete matrix unsuitable for germination. Second, we showed that the proportion of nondispersing seeds in urban patches measured in a common environment is significantly higher than in surrounding, unfragmented populations. Third, by using a quantitative genetic model, we estimated that the pattern is consistent with short-term evolution that occurs over approximately 5-12 generations of selection, which is generated by a high cost of dispersal in urban populations. This study shows that a high cost of dispersal after recent fragmentation causes rapid evolution toward lower dispersal.},

Our model considers the elemental composition of organic matter and the principle of its homeostasis explicitly. New predictions emerge, in particular, (1) stoichiometric constraints generate a trade-off between the R* values of decomposers for the two resources; (2) they create favorable conditions for the coexistence of decomposers limited by different resources and with different elemental demands; (3) however, combined with conditions on species-specific equilibrium limitation, they draw decomposers toward colimitation by the organic and inorganic resources on an evolutionary time scale. Moreover, we derive the conditions under which decomposers switch from consumption to excretion of the inorganic resource. We expect our predictions to be useful in explaining the community structure of decomposers and their interactions with other consumers of inorganic resources, particularly primary producers.},

abstract = {Heterotrophic microbial decomposers, such as bacteria and fungi, immobilize or mineralize inorganic elements, depending on their elemental composition and that of their organic resource. This fact has major implications for their interactions with other consumers of inorganic elements. We combine the stoichiometric and resource-ratio approaches in a model describing the use by decomposers of an organic and an inorganic resource containing the same essential element, to study its consequences on decomposer interactions and their role in elemental cycling. Our model considers the elemental composition of organic matter and the principle of its homeostasis explicitly. New predictions emerge, in particular, (1) stoichiometric constraints generate a trade-off between the R* values of decomposers for the two resources; (2) they create favorable conditions for the coexistence of decomposers limited by different resources and with different elemental demands; (3) however, combined with conditions on species-specific equilibrium limitation, they draw decomposers toward colimitation by the organic and inorganic resources on an evolutionary time scale. Moreover, we derive the conditions under which decomposers switch from consumption to excretion of the inorganic resource. We expect our predictions to be useful in explaining the community structure of decomposers and their interactions with other consumers of inorganic resources, particularly primary producers.},

abstract = {Many derivations of effective population sizes have been suggested in the literature; however, few account for the breeding structure and none can readily be expanded to subdivided populations. Breeding structures influence gene correlations through their effects on the number of breeding individuals of each sex, the mean number of progeny per female, and the variance in the number of progeny produced by males and females. Additionally, hierarchical structuring in a population is determined by the number of breeding groups and the migration rates of males and females among such groups. This study derives analytical solutions for effective sizes that can be applied to subdivided populations. Parameters that encapsulate breeding structure and subdivision are utilized to derive the traditional inbreeding and variance effective sizes. Also, it is shown that effective sizes can be determined for any hierarchical level of population structure for which gene correlations can accrue. Derivations of effective sizes for the accumulation of gene correlations within breeding groups (coancestral effective size) and among breeding groups (intergroup effective size) are given. The results converge to traditional, single population measures when similar assumptions are applied. In particular, inbreeding and intergroup effective sizes are shown to be special cases of the coancestral effective size, and intergroup and variance effective sizes will be equal if the population census remains constant. Instantaneous solutions for effective sizes, at any time after gene correlation begins to accrue, are given in terms of traditional F statistics or transition equations. All effective sizes are shown to converge upon a common asymptotic value when breeding tactics and migration rates are constant. The asymptotic effective size can be expressed in terms of the fixation indices and the number of breeding groups; however, the rate of approach to the asymptote is dependent upon dispersal rates. For accurate assessment of effective sizes, initial, instantaneous or asymptotic, the expressions must be applied at the lowest levels at which migration among breeding groups is nonrandom. Thus, the expressions may be applicable to lineages within socially structured populations, fragmented populations (if random exchange of genes prevails within each population), or combinations of intra- and interpopulation discontinuities of gene flow. Failure to recognize internal structures of populations may lead to considerable overestimates of inbreeding effective size, while usually underestimating variance effective size.},

abstract = {A general model of competitive and apparent competitive interactions in a spatially-variable environment is developed and analyzed to extend findings on coexistence in a temporally-variable environment to the spatial case and to elucidate new principles. In particular, coexistence mechanisms are divided into variation-dependent and variation-independent mechanisms with variation-dependent mechanisms including spatial generalizations of relative nonlinearity and the storage effect. Although directly analogous to the corresponding temporal mechanisms, these spatial mechanisms involve different life history traits which suggest that the spatial storage effect should arise more commonly than the temporal storage effect and spatial relative nonlinearity should arise less commonly than temporal relative nonlinearity. Additional mechanisms occur in the spatial case due to spatial covariance between the finite rate of increase of a local population and its local abundance, which has no clear temporal analogue. A limited analysis of these additional mechanisms shows that they have similar properties to the storage effect and relative nonlinearity and potentially may be considered as enlargements of the earlier mechanisms. The rate of increase of a species perturbed to low density is used to quantify coexistence. A general quadratic approximation, which is exact in some important cases, divides this rate of increase into contributions from the various mechanisms above and admits no other mechanisms, suggesting that opportunities for coexistence in a spatially-variable environment are fully characterized by these mechanisms within this general model. Three spatially-implicit models are analyzed as illustrations of the general findings and of techniques using small variance approximations. The contributions to coexistence of the various mechanisms are expressed in terms of simple interpretable formulae. These spatially-implicit models include a model of an annual plant community, a spatial multispecies version of the lottery model, and a multispecies model of an insect community competing for spatially-patchy and ephemeral food.},

abstract = {It is now well established theoretically that the stability of a population or community on a large spatial scale may depend on heterogeneities, fluctuations or instabilities on smeller scales. Asynchrony of local population fluctuations is often viewed as an alternative to density dependence in achieving long-term regional population stability. However, it is shown here that fluctuations achieve this effect only through their interaction with density-dependent processes. This observation relies on the fact that large spatial scales reflect the average of small scale variation. When local population dynamics are nonlinear (a reflection of density dependence), the variance on the small scale affects the average at the larger scale. This nonlinear averaging that links small and larger scales may have stabilising or diversity promoting effects in many systems. How nonlinear averaging leeds to these effects can be understood by a simple graphical technique.},

abstract = {The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexis- tence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantifica- tion shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific inter- actions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are es- sential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coex- istence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover},

In this setting local stochastic phenomena have a systematic effect on average population density and this effect does not disappear in large populations. This result is an outcome of the interaction of the three ingredients in the models and it says that stochastic models of systems of patches can be expected to give results for average population density that differ systematically from those of deterministic models. The magnitude of these differences is related to the degree of nonlinearity of local dynamics and the magnitude of local variability. These results explain those obtained from a number of previously published models which give conclusions that differ from those of deterministic models. Results are also obtained that show how stochastic models of systems of patches may be simplified to facilitate their study.},

abstract = {A stochastic model is developed for competition among organisms living in a patchy and varying environment. The model is designed to be suitable for species with sedentary adults and widely dispersing larvae or propagules, and applies best to marine systems but may also be adequate for some terrestrial systems. Three kinds of environmental variation are incorporated simultaneously in the model. These are pure spatial variation, pure temporal variation, and the space × time interaction. All three kinds of variation can promote coexistence, and when variation is restricted to immigration rates, all three kinds act very similarly. Moreover, for long-lived organisms their action is nearly identical, and their effects, when present together, combine equivalently. For short-lived organisms, however, pure temporal variation is a less effective promoter of coexistence. Variation in death rates acts quite differently from variation in birth rates for it may demote coexistence in some circumstances, while promoting coexistence in other circumstances. Furthermore, pure spatial variation in death rates has quite different effects than other kinds of death-rate variation. In addition to conditions for coexistence, information is given on population fluctuations, convergence to stationary distributions, and asymptotic distributions for long-lived organisms. While the model is presented as an ecological model, a genetical interpretation is also possible. This leads to new suggested mechanisms for the maintenance of polymorphisms in populations.},

Resource pulsing is a special form of environmental variation, and the general theory of coexistence in variable environments suggests specific mechanisms by which rainfall variability might contribute to the maintenance of high species diversity in arid ecosystems. In this review, we discuss physiological, morphological, and life-history traits that facilitate plant survival and growth in strongly water-limited variable environments, outlining how species differences in these traits may promote diversity. Our analysis emphasizes that the variability of pulsed environments does not reduce the importance of species interactions in structuring communities, but instead provides axes of ecological differentiation between species that facilitate their coexistence. Pulses of rainfall also influence higher trophic levels and entire food webs.

abstract = {Harsh conditions (e.g., mortality and stress) reduce population growth rates directly; secondarily, they may reduce the intensity of interactions between organisms. Near-exclusive focus on the secondary effect of these forms of harshness has led ecologists to believe that they reduce the importance of ecological interactions, such as competition, and favor coexistence of even ecologically very similar species. By examining both the costs and the benefits, we show that harshness alone does not lessen the importance of species interactions or limit their role in community structure. Species coexistence requires niche differences, and harshness does not in itself make coexistence more likely. Fluctuations in environmental conditions (e.g., disturbance, seasonal change, and weather variation) also have been regarded as decreasing species interactions and favoring coexistence, but we argue that coexistence can only be favored when fluctuations create spatial or temporal niche opportunities. We argue that important diversity-promoting roles for harsh and fluctuating conditions depend on deviations from the assumptions of additive effects and linear dependencies most commonly found in ecological models. Such considerations imply strong roles for species interactions in the diversity of a community.},

abstract = {A general model shows how the long-term growth rate of a population can be partioned into components representing various mechanisms of maintenance of species diversity. One component summarises the effects of fluctuation-independent mechanisms, which include classical resource partioning and frequency-dependent herbivory. Two other components represent fluctuation-dependent mechanisms, the storage effect and rlative nonlinearity of competition. The gneral model shows how a community will track an equilibrium set by fluctuation-independent mechanisms and the environmental state when community dynamics are faster tha the rate of environmental change. Fluctuation-dependent mechanisms can be important for diversity maintenance with or without such tracking, but on long timesclaes their effects are indistinguishable from those of fluctuation-independent mechanisms. These considerations lead to a hierarchical view of mechanisms of diversity maintenance where the effects of different timescales are partitioned or merged depending on the timescale of observation. These issueas are illustrated with model examples involving various combinations of resource partitioning, fluctuations in recruitment rates, variation in the timiming of germination, and seasonality. The very long timescales associated with climate chnage contain many complexities but nevertheless many ideas applicable to shorter timescales may be userful in modified form},

abstract = {Competition and predation are the most heavily investigated species interactions in ecology, dominating studies of species diversity maintenance. However, these two interactions are most commonly viewed highly asymmetrically. Competition for resources is seen as the primary interaction limiting diversity, with predation modifying what competition does, although theoretical models have long supported diverse views. Here we show, using a comprehensive three-trophic-level model, that competition and predation should be viewed symmetrically: these two interactions are equally able to either limit or promote diversity. Diversity maintenance requires within-species density feedback loops to be stronger than between-species feedback loops. We quantify the contributions of predation and competition to these loops in a simple, interpretable form, showing their equivalent potential to strengthen or weaken diversity maintenance. Moreover, we show that competition and predation can undermine each other, with the tendency of the stronger interaction to promote or limit diversity prevailing. The past failure to appreciate the symmetrical effects and interactions of competition and predation has unduly restricted diversity maintenance studies. A multitrophic perspective should be adopted to examine a greater variety of possible effects of predation than generally considered in the past. Conservation and management strategies need to be much more concerned with the implications of changes in the strengths of trophic interactions.},

abstract = {Connectivity is critical to the maintenance of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes, but its effects differ depending on the arrangement of linkages within a habitat network. Additionally, heterogeneity in habitat quality within the habitat network can alter patterns of diversity at local and regional scales in the metacommunity. Using a controlled experiment we examined the interactive effects of habitat connectivity, network form (linear vs square), and habitat patch quality on a moss-inhabiting microarthropod community. We fragmented moss habitat while controlling for habitat loss, and altered habitat patch quality by regulating moisture conditions in landscapes differing in patch arrangement. Habitat patch quality had a significant effect on patterns of species richness, extinction, abundance and biomass. The effects of network form on diversity were strongest in heterogeneous landscapes. Gamma and beta diversity were greatest in continuous and linear landscapes. However, linear habitat networks showed marked patch specific edge effects that were detrimental to diversity under heterogeneous conditions. We provide direct evidence that habitat network structure impacts species community properties through mass effects, that are most evident when heterogeneity in habitat patch quality is present within the network. We conclude that habitat quality at the individual patch level and the distribution of high-quality habitat within the network are important factors affecting biodiversity in metacommunities.},

A current problem with neutral theory is that m lacks a clear biological interpretation. Here, we derive analytical expressions that relate the immigration parameter m to the geometry of the plot defining the local community and the parameters of a dispersal kernel. Our results facilitate more rigorous and extensive tests of the neutral theory: we conduct a test of neutral theory by comparing estimates of m derived from fits to empirical species abundance distributions to those derived from dispersal kernels and find acceptable correspondence; and we generate a new prediction of neutral theory by investigating how the shapes of species abundance distributions change theoretically as the spatial scale of observation changes. We also discuss how our main analytical results can be used to assess the error in the mean-field approximations associated with spatially implicit formulations of neutral theory.},

Emerging evidence from four linked U.S. research sites suggests it is essential to examine processes at multiple scales simultaneously when explaining the evolution of urban residential landscapes. Additionally, focusing on urbanization dynamics across multiple sites with a shared research design may yield fruitful comparative insights. The following processes and social-hierarchical scales significantly influence the spatial configurations of residential landscapes: household-level characteristics and environmental attitudes; formal and informal institutions at the neighborhood scale; and municipal-scale land-use governance. While adopting a multi-scale and multi-site approach produces research challenges, doing so is critical to advancing understanding of coupled socio- ecological systems and associated vulnerabilities in a dynamic and environmentally important setting: residential landscapes.},

abstract = {The field of microbiome research is arguably one of the fastest growing in biology. Bacteria feature prominently in studies on animal health, but fungi appear to be the more prominent functional symbionts for plants. Despite the similarities in the ecological organization and evolutionary importance of animal-bacterial and plant–fungal microbiomes, there is a general failure across disciplines to integrate the advances made in each system. Researchers studying bacterial symbionts in animals benefit from greater access to efficient sequencing pipelines and taxonomic reference databases, perhaps due to high medical and veterinary interest. However, researchers studying plant–fungal symbionts benefit from the relative tractability of fungi under laboratory conditions and ease of cultivation. Thus each system has strengths to offer, but both suffer from the lack of a common conceptual framework. We argue that community ecology best illuminates complex species interactions across space and time. In this synthesis we compare and contrast the animal-bacterial and plant–fungal microbiomes using six core theories in community ecology (i.e., succession, community assembly, metacommunities, multitrophic interactions, disturbance, restoration). The examples and questions raised are meant to spark discussion amongst biologists and lead to the integration of these two systems, as well as more informative, manipulatory experiments on microbiomes research.},

We review published studies concerning the hydrologic controls of N transport in near-stream zones, and subsequently present several geomorphic and hydrodynamic scenarios relating N biogeochemistry and its response to hydrologic events (of both varying magnitude and seasons).

Comparisons of these relations for fractals and natural networks suggest that network entropy can contribute to clarify important points concerning self-similar properties of river networks.

abstract = {Headwater streams are ubiquitous in the landscape and are important sources of water, sediments and biota for downstream reaches. They are critical sites for organic matter processing and nutrient cycling, and may be vital for maintaining the ‘health' of whole river networks. 2. Macroinvertebrates are an important component of biodiversity in stream ecosystems and studies of macroinvertebrate diversity in headwater streams have mostly viewed stream systems as linear reaches rather than as networks, although the latter may be more appropriate to the study of diversity patterns in headwater systems. 3. Studies of macroinvertebrate diversity in headwater streams from around the world illustrated that taxonomic richness is highly variable among continents and regions, and studies addressing longitudinal changes in taxonomic richness of macroinvertebrates generally found highest richness in mid-order streams. 4. When stream systems are viewed as networks at the landscape-scale, a-diversity may be low in individual headwater streams but high b-diversity among headwater streams within catchments and among catchments may generate high c-diversity. 5. Differing ability and opportunity for dispersal of macroinvertebrates, great physical habitat heterogeneity in headwater streams, and a wide range in local environmental conditions may all contribute to high b-diversity among headwater streams both within and among catchments. 6. Moving beyond linear conceptual models of stream ecosystems to consider the role that spatial structure of river networks might play in determining diversity patterns at the landscape scale is a promising avenue for future research.

Specifically, the model is of an annual plant, the seeds of which can either germinate and yield more seeds in numbers which depend on environmental conditions, or remain dormant in the soil and undergo some decay according to their viability. The optimal germination fraction is derived for any combination of probabilities of the yield of seeds per germinating seed, and of various values of the viability of the seeds. The relevance of the model is discussed.},

abstract = {A model for the evolution of dispersal in fluctuating environments is extended to environments that are temporally correlated and spatially heterogeneous. The effects of dormancy also are examined. In some cases, evolutionarily stable strategies result, and are estimated through simulations and through analytical approximations. However, in other cases, e.g., in spatially heterogeneous environ- ments, or in the homogeneous case with negative temporal correlation, there is no intermediate evolutionarily stable strategy; rather, in some situations the “best” type, termed an evolutionarily compatible strategy (ECS), is one that can invade any other single type, but also is open to invasion by any type. For these cases, it is conjectured that there is a stable coexisting band of types, not necessarily including the ECS. In general, positive (Markovian) temporal correlations decrease the optimal dispersal fraction by increasing the average yield of non-dispersing seeds; dormancy has a similar effect. Spatial heterogeneity has some features in common with positive temporal correlations, but the structure of the autocorrela- tion function is more complicated. Optimal dispersal is decreased; but as mentioned above, there is no ESS in general. Diffuse competitive effects may not be understood entirely in terms of pairwise interactions, and a variety of open problems exist in characterizing interactions among multiple types},

abstract = {This report describes and explains regularities in the numbers and kinds of trophic links in community food webs. To a first approximation, the mean number of trophic links in a community food web is proportional to the total number of trophic species. The mean number of trophic links between any two categories of trophic species (basal, intermediate, and top) is proportional to the geometric mean number of species in the categories joined. These linear relationships, and scale-invariance in the proportions of basal, intermediate, and top species, make it possible to predict with remarkable precision the proportions of each kind of trophic link among all community food webs. The differences between food webs in constant and in fluctuating environments reflect apparently greater constraints on the trophic organization of food webs in fluctuating environments.},

abstract = {Measuring the numerical abundance and average body size of individuals of each species in an ecological community's food web reveals new patterns and illuminates old ones. This approach is illustrated using data from the pelagic community of a small lake: Tuesday Lake, Michigan, United States. Body mass varies almost 12 orders of magnitude. Numerical abundance varies almost 10 orders of magnitude. Biomass abundance (average body mass times numerical abundance) varies only 5 orders of magnitude. A new food web graph, which plots species and trophic links in the plane spanned by body mass and numerical abundance, illustrates the nearly inverse relationship between body mass and numerical abundance, as well as the pattern of energy flow in the community. Species with small average body mass occur low in the food web of Tuesday Lake and are numerically abundant. Larger-bodied species occur higher in the food web and are numerically rarer. Average body size explains more of the variation in numerical abundance than does trophic height. The trivariate description of an ecological community by using the food web, average body sizes, and numerical abundance includes many well studied bivariate and univariate relationships based on subsets of these three variables. We are not aware of any single community for which all of these relationships have been analyzed simultaneously. Our approach demonstrates the connectedness of ecological patterns traditionally treated as independent. Moreover, knowing the food web gives new insight into the disputed form of the allometric relationship between body mass and abundance.},

This paradigm is frequently applied to processes stimulated by one or a few precipitation events within a growing season. Here we expand the original framework in time and space and include other pulses that interact with rainfall. This new hierarchical pulse-dynamics framework integrates space and time through pulse-driven exchanges, interactions, tran-sitions, and transfers that occur across individual to multiple pulses extending from micro to watershed scales. Climate change will likely alter the size, fre-quency, and intensity of precipitation pulses in the future, and arid-land ecosystems are known to be highly sensitive to climate variability. Thus, a more comprehensive understanding of arid-land pulse dynamics is needed to determine how these ecosystems will respond to, and be shaped by, increased climate variability.},

abstract = {The global reach of human activities affects all natural ecosystems, so that the environment is best viewed as a social–ecological system. Consequently, a more integrative approach to environmental science, one that bridges the biophysical and social domains, is sorely needed. Although models and frameworks for social–ecological systems exist, few are explicitly designed to guide a long-term interdisciplinary research program. Here, we present an iterative framework, “Press–Pulse Dynamics” (PPD), that integrates the bio- physical and social sciences through an understanding of how human behaviors affect “press” and “pulse” dynamics and ecosystem processes. Such dynamics and processes, in turn, influence ecosystem services – thereby altering human behaviors and initiating feedbacks that impact the original dynamics and processes. We believe that research guided by the PPD framework will lead to a more thorough understanding of social–ecological systems and generate the knowledge needed to address pervasive environmental problems},

Here, we use positional cloning methods to identify the major chromosome locus controlling armor plate patterning in wild threespine sticklebacks. Mapping, sequencing, and transgenic studies show that the Ectodysplasin (EDA) signaling pathway plays a key role in evolutionary change in natural populations and that parallel evolution of stickleback low-plated phenotypes at most freshwater locations around the world has occurred by repeated selection of Eda alleles derived from an ancestral low-plated haplotype that first appeared more than two million years ago. Members of this clade of low-plated alleles are present at low frequencies in marine fish, which suggests that standing genetic variation can provide a molecular basis for rapid, parallel evolution of dramatic phenotypic change in nature.},

Such measures should also take into account the degree of distinctness of the resource states from the point of view of the organisms concerned. An ecoassay of the distinctness of resource states may well be easier and more meaningful than measurements of physical and chemical factors. We propose that the species composition of communities utilizing different resource states may be used to develop weighting factors with which each state may be weighted in proportion to its degree of distinctness. The weighting factors are used in the development of indices of niche breadth and overlap that correct for variation in the range and distinctness of resource states and that suffer less from human subjectivity than do the measures used to date. The use of such indices and the relationship of niche overlap to competition are discussed.},

abstract = {Evolutionarily stable dispersal strategies are calculated for a generalized two-dimensional stepping-stone model in which dispersal is not restricted to nearest neighbour sites. It is shown analytically that to an excellent approximation the ESS is independent of the dispersal pattern and is the same as the result of an earlier paper which used the simple but unrealistic island model (the dispersal survival rate of the previous paper must be replaced by an average value). When dispersal to different distances is under separate genetic control it is also possible to make general predictions concerning the fall-off of genetic correlation with distance. Two generalizations of the model are considered: random extinction of sites (creating empty sites which are opportunities for colonization), and perennation of existing occupants. These modifications are intended to bring the model closer to two real-world circumstances: dispersal between discrete colonies of animals living on a patchy resource, and seed and pollen dispersal in evenly distributed plant species. Simulations are required to validate any extensions of the analytic model; I present a relatively fast technique for determining the ESS, which relies in part on the analytic results. ?? 1982.},

abstract = {The high alpha-diversity of tropical forests has been amply documented, but beta-diversity-how species composition changes with distance-has seldom been studied. We present quantitative estimates of beta-diversity for tropical trees by comparing species composition of plots in lowland terra firme forest in Panama, Ecuador, and Peru. We compare observations with predictions derived from a neutral model in which habitat is uniform and only dispersal and speciation influence species turnover. We find that beta-diversity is higher in Panama than in western Amazonia and that patterns in both areas are inconsistent with the neutral model. In Panama, habitat variation appears to increase species turnover relative to Amazonia, where unexpectedly low turnover over great distances suggests that population densities of some species are bounded by as yet unidentified processes. At intermediate scales in both regions, observations can be matched by theory, suggesting that dispersal limitation, with speciation, influences species turnover.},

abstract = {The objective was to study some of the factors determining the distribution, abundance and age structure of a natural population of intertidal barnacles at Millport, Scotland. Individual barnacles were mapped and their survival followed for 2-1/2 years at different tidal levels and at various population densities. Thais lapillus, a predatory gastropod, was excluded from some populations by cages fastened with screws to the rock; it was also placed inside cages to measure its rate of feeding. Recruitment from the plankton is limited by space on the surface. Early mortality is caused by warm weather or breakage during storms. During rapid growth at high population densities intraspecific crowding (crushing, displacement, smothering) was observed. Mortality increases with population density. Older barnacles are seldom affected by crowding. The upper shore limit of distribution is determined by adverse weather. Mortality is high during the first year of life; occasional good survival results in dominant year classes at high levels. Predatory Thais occurred in the middle of the shore, most commonly in summer and autumn. They fed about 60{\%} of the time in summer, when feeding rates were highest. Thais chose the larger barnacles as prey; only above the upper limit of Thais did barnacles survive more than 2 years. From population censuses and feeding rate measurements the mortality rate of barnacles due to predation was calculated. Expressed as a proportion of the total barnacle mortality rate, the results showed that the Thais population could account for all the mortality at three shore levels in summer and for smaller proportions in the other seasons over 2 years. By eliminating the larger barnacles and thus allowing space for young, fast-growing ones, Thais increases the productivity of the barnacle population; this tends to produce the "optimum yield" for the predator population. Barnacle zonation in the intertidal region is bounded at the top by deleterious physical factors and at the bottom by biotic ones (competition for space and predation). Fluctuations in these factors are greatest at the upper and lower limits; recruitment and mortality are less variable in the middle shore. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author},

abstract = {To address the idea that the process of interspecific competition can be inferred from data on geographical distribution alone and that evidence from geographical distribution implies an important role for interspecific competition in shaping ecological communities, we reexamine the occurrence of "true checkerboard" distributions among the land and freshwater birds in three Melanesian archipelagoes: Vanuatu, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Solomon Islands. We use the most recently published distributional records and explicitly include the geography of the distributions of species within each archipelago. We use the overlap of convex hulls to estimate the overlap in the geographic range for each pair of species in each of these archipelagoes. We define a "true checkerboard" to consist of a pair of species with exclusive island-by-island distributions, but that have overlapping geographical ranges. To avoid the "dilution effect," we follow Diamond and Gilpin in focusing only on congeneric and within-guild species pairs as potential competitors. Few, if any, "true checkerboards" exist in these archipelagoes that could possibly have been influenced by competitive interactions, and even "true checkerboards" can arise for reasons other than interspecific competition. The similarity between related species pairs (congeneric and within-guild pairs) and unrelated species pairs in their deviation from expectation of the number of islands shared and the overlap of their geographic ranges indicates that these are not distinct statistical populations, but rather a single population of species pairs. Our result, which is based on an examination of the distributional data alone, is consistent with the interpretation that, in these avifaunas, the distributions of congeneric, within-guild, and unrelated species pairs are shaped by a common set of biological and physical environmental processes.},

abstract = {Regional differences in species number have puzzled naturalists since the early 1800's, and explanations account for a large part of modern ecological research. Two venerable observations form the cornerstone of our knowledge on the subject: The number of species within a taxonomic group tends to increase with decreasing latitude (see Fischer 1960; Pianka 1966); and the number of species within a taxonomic group tends to increase with increasing area (see Preston 1960, 1962; Williams 1964; MacArthur and Wilson 1967; Simberloff 1972). Despite early research on the latter trend (the species-area relationship), ecologists have studied it intensely only in the last 50 yr. The relationship was originally envisioned as an empirical tool and used in three principle ways: (1) to determine optimal sample size and sample number, (2) to determine the minimum area of a "community," and (3) to predict the number of species in areas larger than those sampled. All three uses are discussed by Kilburn (1966).},

abstract = {Residential landscapes are a common setting of human-environment interactions. These ubiquitous ecosystems provide social and ecological services, and yard maintenance leads to intended and unintended ecological outcomes. The ecological characteristics of residential landscapes and the human drivers of landscape management have been the focus of disciplinary studies, often at a single scale of analysis. However, an interdisciplinary examination of residential landscapes is needed to understand the feedbacks and tradeoffs of these complex adaptive social-ecological systems as a whole. Our aim is to synthesize the diversity of perspectives, scales of analysis, and findings from the literature in order to 1) contribute to an interdisciplinary understanding of residential landscapes and 2) identify research needs while providing a robust conceptual approach for future studies. We synthesize 256 studies from the literature and develop an interdisciplinary, multi-scalar framework on residential landscape dynamics. Complex human drivers (attitudinal, structural, and institutional factors) at multiple scales influence management practices and the feedbacks with biophysical characteristics of residential landscapes. However, gaps exist in our interdisciplinary understanding of residential landscapes within four key but understudied areas: 1) the link between social drivers and ecological outcomes of management decisions, 2) the ecosystem services provided by these landscapes to residents, 3) the interactions of social drivers and ecological characteristics across scales, and 4) generalizations of patterns and processes across cities. Our systems perspective will help to guide future interdisciplinary collaborations to integrate theories and research methods across geographic locations and spatial scales.},

abstract = {Biotic assemblages are said to be nested when the species making up relatively species-poor biotas comprise subsets of the species present at richer sites. Because species number and site area are often correlated, previous studies have suggested that nestedness may be relevant to questions of how habitat subdivision affects species diversity, particularly with respect to the question of whether a single large, contiguous patch of habitat will generally contain more species than collections of smaller patches having the same total combined area. However, inferences from analyses of nestedness are complicated by (1) variability in degrees of nestedness measured in natural communities, (2) variability in species-area relationships, and (3) the fact that nestedness statistics do not account for the size of habitat patches, only in the degree of overlap among sites with different numbers of species. By comparing various indices of nestedness with a ''saturation index'' that more directly measures the effect of habitat subdivision, it is shown that the first two of these factors are not as important as the third. Whether a single large site or several smaller ones having the same total combined area maximizes species diversity is dependent on (1) overlap in species composition among sites and (2) the number of species per unit area in the different sites. Because nestedness indices do not account for species number at a site, they cannot accurately predict how habitat subdivision affects species diversity patterns. Still, nestedness analyses are important in that they indicate the degree to which rare species tend to be found in the largest, or the most species-rich, sites, patterns not revealed by the saturation index. Both types of analysis are important in order to obtain a more complete picture of how species richness and compositional patterns are influenced by habitat subdivision.},

abstract = {Biotic communities inhabiting collections of insular habitat patches often exhibit compositional patterns described as ''nested subsets''. In nested biotas, the assemblages of species in relatively depauperate sites comprise successive subsets of species in relatively richer sites. In theory, nestedness may result from selective extinction, selective colonization, or other mechanisms, such as nested habitats. Allopatric speciation is expected to reduce nestedness. Previous studies, based largely on comparisons between land-bridge and oceanic archipelagos, have emphasized the role of selective extinction. However, colonization could also be important in generating strong patterns of nestedness. We apply a recently published index of nestedness to more than 50 island biogeographic data sets, and examine the roles of colonization, extinction, endemism, and, to a limited extent, habitat variability on the degree on nestedness. Most data sets exhibit a significant degree of nestedness, although there is no general tendency for land-bridge biotas to appear more nested than oceanic ones. Endemic species are shown to generally reduce nestedness. Comparisons between groups of non-endemic species differing in overwater or inter-patch dispersal ability indicate that superior dispersers generally exhibit a greater degree of nestedness than poorer dispersers, a result opposite that expected if colonization were a less predictable process than extinction. These results suggest that frequent colonization is likely to enhance nestedness, thereby increasing the compositional overlap among insular biotas. The prevalence of selective extinction in natural communities remains in question. The importance of colonization in generating and maintaining nested subsets suggests that (1) minimum critical areas will be difficult to determine from pat terns of species distributions on islands; (2) multiple conservation sites are likely to be required to preserve communities in subdivided landscapes, and (3) management of dispersal processes may be as important to preserving species and communities as is minimizing extinctions.},

abstract = {Secondary succession reflects, at least in part, community assembly-the sequences of colonizations and extinctions. These processes in turn are expected to be sensitive to the size of the site undergoing assembly and its location relative to source pools. In this paper we describe patterns of succession over 18 years in an experimentally fragmented landscape created in eastern Kansas, USA, in 1984. The design of the experiment permits one to assess the influence of patch size and landscape position on successional dynamics. The general trajectory of succession follows that typical of succession in much of the eastern United States. In the initial years of the study, there was relatively little effect of patch size or distance to sources. Here we show that spatial effects in this system have become increasingly evident with time, as gauged both by repeated-measures ANOVA and ordination techniques. Woody plants have colonized more rapidly (per unit area) on large and nearby patches., Species richness at a local (within-quadrat) scale in general has increased, with slightly greater richness in large than in small patches later in the study. Temporal stability in community composition has generally been greater in large patches. Spatial heterogeneity in community composition has increased during succession, but with different patterns in large and small patches. This long-term experiment suggests that landscape structure influences many aspects of community structure and dynamics during succession, and that such effects become more pronounced with the passage of time.},

Recent linkage disequilibrium (LD) and sperm-typing studies suggest that recombination rates vary tremendously across the human genome, with most events occurring in narrow "hotspots." To examine variation in fine-scale recombination patterns among individuals, we used dense, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data collected in nuclear families to localize crossovers with high spatial resolution. This analysis revealed that overall recombination hotspot usage is similar in males and females, with individual hotspots often active in both sexes. Across the genome, roughly 60{\%} of crossovers occurred in hotspots inferred from LD studies. Notably, however, we found extensive and heritable variation among both males and females in the proportion of crossovers occurring in these hotspots.},

We present examples of how the spatial scale of a study influences observed patterns and their interpretation, and discuss how the size of an experimental arena influences the degree to which the dynamics of studied populations are influenced by exchange processes (immigration and emigration). The results of small-scale field experiments in streams will often be strongly influenced by the per capita exchange rates of organisms and differences in exchange rates may explain differences in the perceived effects of stream manipulations across scales. Spatial extent also influences the amount of spatial heterogeneity within a study site or arena, with important consequences for the outcome of predator-prey interactions. We suggest that changes in the availability of prey refuges may help explain why predator manipulations in streams appear to weaken as arena size increases. We also recommend that new techniques for decomposing and quantifying spatial heterogeneity be applied to characterize scale-dependent variation in freshwater systems. Lastly, we discuss the pitfalls of mismatching the temporal scale of experiments and models. Models incorporating spatial heterogeneity and the behaviour of organisms are needed to predict the short-term outcome of perturbations in streams, whereas models predicting long-term dynamics will need to integrate the impacts of episodic disturbance and all life history stages of organisms. In general, we recommend that freshwater ecologists undertake more multi-scale sampling and experimentation to examine patterns and processes at multiple scales, and make greater attempts to match the scales of their observations and experiments to the characteristic scales of the phenomena that they investigate.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Are local ecological communities ever saturated with species? That is, do they ever reach a point where species from the regional pool are unable to invade the local habitat because of exclusion by resident species? 2. We review the theoretical evidence for saturation in various community models and find that non-interactive models predict the absence of saturation as expected, but that interactive models do not uniformly predict saturation. 3. Instead, models where coexistence is based on niche space heterogeneity predict saturation, whereas those where coexistence is based upon spatial heterogeneity yield mixed predictions. 4. Thus, theory says that species interactions are a necessary but not sufficient condition for local saturation in ecological time. 5. We then argue that unsaturated (Type I) assemblages are likely to be ubiquitous in nature and that even saturated (Type II) assemblages may not show hard limits to richness over evolutionary time-scales. 6. If local richness is not often saturated, then regional richness is freed from local constraint, and other limits on regional richness (which, in turn, limit local rich- ness) become important, including phylogenetic diversification over evolutionary time-scales. 7. Our speculations inevitably suggest that the principal direction of control for species richness is from regional to local. If correct, then the key to community structure may lie in extrinsic biogeography rather than in intrinsic local processes, making community ecology a more historical science.},

abstract = {A regional species pool comprises all species available to colonize a focal site. The roots of the concept are imbedded in island biogeography the-ory, supply-side ecology, and early propagule addition experiments. The pool concept allows ecologists to examine large-scale effects—including ge-ographic area, evolutionary age, and immigration and diversification—on the diversity, composition, and phylogenetic structure of local communi-ties. Both theory and evidence show that pool influences are greatest when local communities are not strongly and predictably structured by species interactions (e.g., under frequent disturbance or if many species are rare). Practical and conceptual issues to consider when delineating species pools include choosing an appropriate spatial scale, whether to account for envi-ronmental filtering, whether to include the species within a fixed geographic area versus those whose geographic ranges overlap with a site, or whether to use databases or geographic data sources. Each issue is discussed in the context of 63 studies using the species pool approach. We conclude that the species pool concept has contributed greatly to our understanding of com-munity dynamics by bridging the gap between large and small spatial scales. Future studies must compare pool characteristics with community structure across multiple regions for a more complete understanding of community assembly.},

Phenotypic variation can be plastic or heritable and both mechanisms can drive phenotypic change at rates comparable to or faster than those of ecological dynamics (e.g. changes in population abundances or spatial distributions). In this study, we compare the effects rapidly induced and rapidly evolving defences have on community dynamics by considering the fast phenotypic change limit using fast-slow systems theory. Our approach allows us to study phenotypically plastic and evolving systems with one overarching theory, thus capturing the effects rapidly induced defences have on ecological dynamics and how those effects differ from the effects of evolving defences. Our results show that rapidly induced defences tend to stabilize community dynamics and that some behaviours observed in rapidly evolving systems cannot be produced by phenotypic plasticity.},

The disparity between experiment and theory is partially due to the high dimensionality of models that include both evolutionary and ecological dynamics. Here we show how the theory of fast-slow dynamical systems can be used to reduce model dimension, and we use that body of theory to study a general predator-prey system exhibiting fast evolution in either the predator or the prey. Our approach yields graphical methods with predictive power about when new and unique dynamics (e.g., completely out-of-phase oscillations and cryptic dynamics) can arise in ecological systems exhibiting fast evolution. In addition, we derive analytical expressions for determining when such behavior arises and how evolution affects qualitative properties of the ecological dynamics. Finally, while the theory requires a separation of timescales between the ecological and evolutionary processes, our approach yields insight into systems where the rates of those processes are comparable and thus is a step toward creating a general ecoevolutionary theory.},

abstract = {Abstract Habitat connectivity is a central factor in shaping aquatic biological communities, but few tools exist to describe and quantify this attribute at a network scale in riverine systems. Here, we develop a new index to quantify longitudinal connectivity of river networks based on the expected probability of an organism being able to move freely between two random points of the network. We apply this index to two fish life histories and evaluate the effects of the number, passability, and placement of barriers on river network connectivity through the use of simulated dendritic ecological networks. We then extend the index to a real world dendritic river system in Newfoundland, Canada. Our results indicate that connectivity in river systems, as represented by our index, is most impacted by the first few barriers added to the system. This is in contrast to terrestrial systems, which are more resilient to low levels of connectivity. The results show a curvilinear relationship between barrier passability and structural connectivity. This suggests that an incremental improvement in passability would result in a greater improvement to river network connectivity for more permeable barriers than for less permeable barriers. Our analysis of the index in simulated and real river networks also showed that barrier placement played an important role in connectivity. Not surprisingly, barriers located near the river mouth have the greatest impact on fish with diadromous life histories while those located near the center of the river network have the most impact on fish with potadromous life histories. The proposed index is conceptually simple and sufficiently flexible to deal with variations in river structure and biological communities. The index will enable researchers to account for connectivity in habitat studies and will also allow resource managers to characterize watersheds, assess cumulative impacts of multiple barriers and determine priorities for restoration.},

This is especially problematic in communities from highly connected habitats, which undergo two opposing forces: differences in environmental conditions of the habitats lead to divergence of the communities, while the dispersal of individuals leads to convergence of the communities. Using a transplant experiment, we experimentally showed that biotic interactions, have a predictable, deterministic impact on zooplankton community structure in a metacommunity of highly interconnected shallow ponds. Fish predation and presence of abundant macrophyte cover. rapidly structured regional communities of zooplankton, both in terms of relative abundances and of cladoceran species richness. Moreover, we could use the relations between the experimentally manipulated environmental conditions and the observed experimental communities to successfully classify the contrasting local communities found in the original neighboring ponds, thus directly relating the experimental results to the actual field situation. Notwithstanding the observed strong impact of local biotic conditions, we also showed that dispersal had an influence on community structure and species richness. Dispersal increased species richness of cladocerans by three species and influenced zooplankton community structure. More-over, dispersal actually made the response to local conditions more deterministic.},

We review studies that explicitly test whether the number of species in a community (species richness) regulates the temporal variability of aggregate community (total biomass, productivity nutrient cycling) and population (density, biomass) properties. Theoretical studies predict that community variability should decline with increasing species richness, while population variability should increase. Many, but not all, empirical studies support these expectations. However, a closer look reveals that several empirical studies have either imperfect experimental designs or biased methods of calculating variability. Furthermore, most theoretical studies rely on highly unrealistic assumptions. We conclude that evidence to support the claim that biodiversity regulates temporal variability is accumulating, but not unequivocal. More research, in a broader array of ecosystem types and with careful attention to methodological considerations, is needed before we can make definitive statements regarding richness-variability relationships.},

Should ecologists prefer experiments with few treatments and many replicates analyzed with ANOVA, or experiments with many treatments and few replicates per treatment analyzed with regression?

In order to deal with the relative sparseness of the monitoring locations in comparison to the number of locations where one might want to make predictions, we make a classification of the river and stream locations. We then implement optimal spatial prediction (ordinary and constrained kriging) from geostatistics. Because of their directed-tree structure, rivers and streams offer special challenges. A complete approach to spatial prediction on a river network is given, with special attention paid to environmental exceedances. The methodology is used to produce a map of Dochange predictions for 2003. Dochange is one of the variables measured as part of the Ecosystem Health Monitoring Program conducted within the Moreton Bay Waterways and Catchments Partnership.},

abstract = {Species diversity may be additively partitioned within and among samples (alpha and beta diversity) from hierarchically scaled studies to assess the proportion of the total diversity (gamma) found in different habitats, landscapes, or regions. We developed a statistical approach for testing null hypotheses that observed partitions of species richness or diversity indices differed from those expected by chance, and we illustrate these tests using data from a hierarchical study of forest-canopy beetles. Two null hypotheses were implemented using individual- and sample-based randomization tests to generate null distributions for alpha and beta components of diversity at multiple sampling scales. The two tests differed in their null distributions and power to detect statistically significant diversity components. Individual-based randomization was more powerful at all hierarchical levels and was sensitive to departures between observed and null partitions due to intraspecific aggregation of individuals. Sample-based randomization had less power but still may be useful for determining whether different habitats show a higher degree of differentiation in species diversity compared with random samples from the landscape. Null hypothesis tests provide a basis for inferences on partitions of species richness or diversity indices at multiple sampling levels, thereby increasing our understanding of how alpha and beta diversity change across spatial scales.},

abstract = {Additive partitioning of species diversity is widely applicable to different kinds of sampling regimes at multiple spatial and temporal scales. In additive partitioning, the diversity within and among samples (alpha and beta) is expressed in the same units of species richness, thus allowing direct comparison of alpha and beta. Despite its broad applicability, there are few demonstrated linkages between additive partitioning and other approaches to analysing diversity. Here, we establish several connections between diversity partitions and patterns of habitat occupancy, rarefaction, and species-area relationships. We show that observed partitions of species richness are equivalent to sample-based rarefaction curves, and expected partitions from randomization tests are approximately equivalent to individual-based rarefaction. Additive partitions can also be applied to species-area relationships to determine the relative contributions of factors influencing the beta-diversity among habitat fragments.},

abstract = {Structural complexity of the habitat often reduces predatory efficiency by reducing prey capture rates. Prey density is often positively correlated with habitat structure because it provides food and substrate to the prey as well as a relative refuge from predators. Dense structure inhibits foraging, allowing abundant, highly profitable prey to coexist with predators. Sparse structure allows efficient foraging and generally contains few highly profitable prey. This suggests that feeding rates of predators may be maximized at intermediate structure. It this true, we might also expect predator growth rates to be higher in intermediate structure habitats. Since diet breadth is thought to be related to rates of encounter with profitable prey, we also expect diets of predators to be narrower at intermediate structure than in either sparsely or densely structured habitats. Bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) restricted to experimental ponds varying in vegetation density grew better and consumed more prey at ...},

abstract = {The Columbia River estuary is a dynamic system in which estuarine turbidity maxima trap and extend the residence time of particles and particle-attached bacteria over those of the water and free-living bacteria. Particle-attached bacteria dominate bacterial activity in the estuary and are an important part of the estuarine food web. PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes from particle-attached and free-living bacteria in the Columbia River, its estuary, and the adjacent coastal ocean were cloned, and 239 partial sequences were determined. A wide diversity was observed at the species level within at least six different bacterial phyla, including most subphyla of the class Proteobacteria. In the estuary, most particle-attached bacterial clones (75{\%}) were related to members of the genus Cytophaga or of the alpha, gamma, or delta subclass of the class Proteobacteria. These same clones, however, were rare in or absent from either the particle-attached or the free-living bacterial communities of the river and the coastal ocean. In contrast, about half (48{\%}) of the free-living estuarine bacterial clones were similar to clones from the river or the coastal ocean. These free-living bacteria were related to groups of cosmopolitan freshwater bacteria (beta-proteobacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and Verrucomicrobium spp.) and groups of marine organisms (gram-positive bacteria and alpha-proteobacteria [SAR11 and Rhodobacter spp.]). These results suggest that rapidly growing particle-attached bacteria develop into a uniquely adapted estuarine community and that free-living estuarine bacteria are similar to members of the river and the coastal ocean microbial communities. The high degree of diversity in the estuary is the result of the mixing of bacterial communities from the river, estuary, and coastal ocean.},

abstract = {Microbes are transported in hydrological networks through many environments, but the nature and dynamics of underlying microbial metacommunities and the impact of downslope inoculation on patterns of microbial diversity across landscapes are unknown. Pyrosequencing of small subunit ribosomal RNA gene hypervariable regions to characterize microbial communities along a hydrological continuum in arctic tundra showed a pattern of decreasing diversity downslope, with highest species richness in soil waters and headwater streams, and lowest richness in lake water. In a downstream lake, 58{\%} and 43{\%} of the bacterial and archaeal taxa, respectively, were also detected in diverse upslope communities, including most of the numerically dominant lake taxa. In contrast, only 18{\%} of microbial eukaryotic taxa in the lake were detected upslope. We suggest that patterns of diversity in surface waters are structured by initial inoculation from microbial reservoirs in soils followed by a species-sorting process during downslope dispersal of both common and rare microbial taxa. Our results suggest that, unlike for metazoans, a substantial portion of bacterial and archaeal diversity in surface freshwaters may originate in complex soil environments.},

abstract = {Seasonal shifts in bacterioplankton community composition in Toolik Lake, a tundra lake on the North Slope of Alaska, were related to shifts in the source (terrestrial versus phytoplankton) and lability of dissolved organic matter (DOM). A shift in community composition, measured by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes, occurred at 4°C in near-surface waters beneath seasonal ice and snow cover in spring. This shift was associated with an annual peak in bacterial productivity ([14C]leucine incorporation) driven by the large influx of labile terrestrial DOM associated with snow meltwater. A second shift occurred after the flux of terrestrial DOM had ended in early summer as ice left the lake and as the phytoplankton community developed. Bacterioplankton communities were composed of persistent populations present throughout the year and transient populations that appeared and disappeared. Most of the transient populations could be divided into those that were advected into the lake with terrestrial DOM in spring and those that grew up from low concentrations during the development of the phytoplankton community in early summer. Sequencing of DNA in DGGE bands demonstrated that most bands represented single ribotypes and that matching bands from different samples represented identical ribotypes. Bacteria were identified as members of globally distributed freshwater phylogenetic clusters within the - and -Proteobacteria, the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides group, and the Actinobacteria.},

Communities in the six rivers shifted synchronously over time, correlating with seasonal shifts in hydrology and biogeochemistry and clustering into three groups: winter/spring, spring freshet, and summer/fall. This synchrony indicates that hemisphere-scale variation in seasonal climate sets the pace of variation in microbial diversity. Moreover, these seasonal communities reassembled each year in all six rivers, suggesting a long-term, predictable succession in the composition of big river bacterioplankton communities.},

abstract = {Bacterioplankton community composition was compared across 10 lakes and 14 streams within the catchment of Toolik Lake, a tundra lake in Arctic Alaska, during seven surveys conducted over three years using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified rDNA. Bacterioplankton communities in streams draining tundra were very different than those in streams draining lakes. Communities in streams draining lakes were similar to communities in lakes. In a connected series of lakes and streams, the stream communities changed with distance from the upstream lake and with changes in water chemistry, suggesting inoculation and dilution with bacteria from soil waters or hyporheic zones. In the same system, lakes shared similar bacterioplankton communities (78{\%} similar) that shifted gradually down the catchment. In contrast, unconnected lakes contained somewhat different communities (67{\%} similar). We found evidence that dispersal influences bacterioplankton communities via advection and dilution (mass effects) in streams, and via inoculation and subsequent growth in lakes. The spatial pattern of bacterioplankton community composition was strongly influenced by interactions among soil water, stream, and lake environments. Our results reveal large differences in lake-specific and stream-specific bacterial community composition over restricted spatial scales ({\textless}10 km) and suggest that geographic distance and connectivity influence the distribution of bacterioplankton communities across a landscape.},

Most river and coastal ocean bacterioplankton were members of common freshwater and marine phylogenetic clusters within the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria.

Such inventories seem an inappropriate fabric from which to weave important ecological generalizations.

abstract = {In the Earth's history, periods of relatively stable climate have often been interrupted by sharp transitions to a contrasting state. One explanation for such events of abrupt change is that they happened when the earth system reached a critical tipping point. However, this remains hard to prove for events in the remote past, and it is even more difficult to predict if and when we might reach a tipping point for abrupt climate change in the future. Here, we analyze eight ancient abrupt climate shifts and show that they were all preceded by a characteristic slowing down of the fluctuations starting well before the actual shift. Such slowing down, measured as increased autocorrelation, can be mathematically shown to be a hallmark of tipping points. Therefore, our results imply independent empirical evidence for the idea that past abrupt shifts were associated with the passing of critical thresholds. Because the mechanism causing slowing down is fundamentally inherent to tipping points, it follows that our way to detect slowing down might be used as a universal early warning signal for upcoming catastrophic change. Because tipping points in ecosystems and other complex systems are notoriously hard to predict in other ways, this is a promising perspective.},

abstract = {Cold air drainage and pooling occur in many mountain valleys, especially at night and during winter. Local climate regimes associated with frequent cold air pooling have substantial impacts on species phenology, distribution and diversity. However, little is known about how the degree and frequency of cold air drainage and pooling will respond to a changing climate. Evidence suggests that, because cold pools are decoupled from the free atmosphere, these local climates may not respond in the same way as regional-scale climates estimated from coarse-grid general circulation models. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that historical changes in the frequency of synoptic conditions have produced complex spatial variations in the resulting climatic changes on the ground. In the mountainous terrain of the Oregon Cascades, we show that, at relatively exposed hill slope and ridge top locations, air temperatures are highly coupled to changes in synoptic circulation patterns at the 700-hPa level, whereas in sheltered valley bottoms, cold air pooling at night and during winter causes temperatures to be largely decoupled from, and relatively insensitive to, 700-hPa flow variations. The result is a complex temperature landscape composed of steep gradients in temporal variation, controlled largely by gradients in elevation and topographic position. When a projected climate warming of 2.5 °C was combined with likely changes in the frequency distribution of synoptic circulation, modelled temperature changes at closely spaced locations diverged widely (by up to 6 °C), with differences equalling or exceeding that of the imposed regional temperature change. Because cold air pooling and consequent atmospheric decoupling occur in many mountain valleys, especially at high latitudes, this phenomenon is likely to be an important consideration in understanding the impacts of climate change in mountainous regions.

abstract = {Bacteria from the genus Polaromonas are dominant phylotypes in clone libraries and culture collections from polar and high-elevation environments. Although Polaromonas has been found on six continents, we do not know if the same phylotypes exist in all locations or if they exhibit genetic isolation by distance patterns. To examine their biogeographic distribution, we analyzed all available, long-read 16S rRNA gene sequences of Polaromonas phylotypes from glacial and periglacial environments across the globe. Using genetic isolation by geographic distance analyses, including Mantel tests and Mantel correlograms, we found that Polaromonas phylotypes are globally distributed showing weak isolation by distance patterns at global scales. More focused analyses using discrete, equally sampled distances classes, revealed that only two distance classes (out of 12 total) showed significant spatial structuring. Overall, our analyses show that most Polaromonas phylotypes are truly globally distributed, but that some, as yet unknown, environmental variable may be selecting for unique phylotypes at a minority of our global sites. Analyses of aerobiological and genomic data suggest that Polaromonas phylotypes are globally distributed as dormant cells through high-elevation air currents; Polaromonas phylotypes are common in air and snow samples from high altitudes, and a glacial-ice metagenome and the two sequenced Polaromonas genomes contain the gene hipA, suggesting that Polaromonas can form dormant cells.},

abstract = {SUMMARY 1. Most metacommunity studies indicate that dispersal processes play a minor role compared with species sorting in explaining metacommunity organisation, in particular, in stream systems. However, the role of dispersal could vary with environmental harshness, as a result of frequent resetting of community succession by disturbances and the selection of generalist species from regional species pools. The importance of dispersal may also be mitigated by species dispersal ability. 2. In this study, we explored how species sorting and dispersal shaped invertebrate and fish metacommunities across streams in three tropical headwater catchments in Bolivia with contrasting environmental harshness, including flow regime, altitude and climate conditions. We addressed the hypothesis that the relative roles of dispersal and species sorting vary with environmental harshness: we predicted that the role of species sorting would predominate in benign conditions, whereas that of dispersal would predominate under moderate environmental harshness, and that neither dispersal nor species sorting would be relevant to explain metacommunities under high environmental harshness. We also hypothesised that the role of dispersal would decrease with increasing species dispersal ability. 3. Although there was little or no spatial autocorrelation of environmental distances (i.e. environmental differences) across the headwater catchments, community similarity correlated more strongly with environmental than spatial distances among headwater sites that had low environmental harshness, but the opposite pattern was observed among sites with moderate environmental harshness. Under high environmental harshness, neither environmental harshness nor spatial distances between sites explained community similarity. 4. Under moderate environmental harshness, the correlation between community similarity and spatial distances was the strongest for moderate dispersers of both invertebrates and fish. Yet, in contrast to fish, strongly dispersing invertebrate taxa were spatial structured, suggesting that they were not able to reach all sites as predicted. 5. Our results suggest the role of dispersal might be underestimated, notably in systems prone to environmental harshness. Better proxies for dispersal, along with the use of spatial distances to account for resistance to animal movements in river systems and that account for flow magnitude and directionality, slope, riparian vegetation, wind and streambed roughness, may promote a more realistic integration of dispersal processes in basic and applied metacommunity research.},

abstract = {Primary producers and decomposers-the two most important groups for the functioning of ecosystems-have complex, indirect interactions. They are indirect mutualists through nutrient cycling, but also competitors for inorganic nutrients due to stoichiometric constraints in decomposers. We examine the conditions under which they are able to coexist, and hence ecosystems are able to persist, using a stoichiometrically explicit minimum model for an ecosystem. The model takes into account the coupling of carbon and a nutrient in the biomass and detritus, the nutrient limitation and the energy-providing role of primary producers, the recycling role of decomposers, and the stoichiometric constraints leading to indirect competition for the nutrient. The model shows that two conditions must be met to ensure coexistence of primary producers and decomposers: (1) decomposers must be limited by the carbon provided by plant detritus, and (2) the difference between the carbon: nutrient ratios of primary producers and decomposers must be sufficiently small. Condition (1) is fulfilled if decomposers are better competitors than primary producers for nutrient uptake. When nutrient uptake by plants and decomposers has a Lotka-Volterra form, these results are robust whether the nutrient cycle is closed or open. When nutrient uptake is donor controlled, however, coexistence is facilitated by an open nutrient cycle. We conclude that ecosystem persistence is not a trivial issue when stoichiometry is taken into account in ecological processes. Strict conditions on the carbon: nutrient ratios and competitive abilities of plants and microorganisms may be required. Given these theoretical results, we highlight the lack of experimental data concerning primary producer and decomposer coexistence conditions, and we suggest that more research has to be performed.

abstract = {Biofilms are complex communities of microorganisms attached to surfaces or associated with interfaces. Despite the focus of modern microbiology research on pure culture, planktonic (free-swimming) bacteria, it is now widely recognized that most bacteria found in natural, clinical, and industrial settings persist in association with surfaces. Furthermore, these microbial communities are often composed of multiple species that interact with each other and their environment. The determination of biofilm architecture, particularly the spatial arrangement of microcolonies (clusters of cells) relative to one another, has profound implications for the function of these complex communities. Numerous new experimental approaches and methodologies have been developed in order to explore metabolic interactions, phylogenetic groupings, and competition among members of the biofilm. To complement this broad view of biofilm ecology, individual organisms have been studied using molecular genetics in order to identify the genes required for biofilm development and to dissect the regulatory pathways that control the plankton-to-biofilm transition. These molecular genetic studies have led to the emergence of the concept of biofilm formation as a novel system for the study of bacterial development. The recent explosion in the field of biofilm research has led to exciting progress in the development of new technologies for studying these communities, advanced our understanding of the ecological significance of surface-attached bacteria, and provided new insights into the molecular genetic basis of biofilm development.},

abstract = {Data on small-scale spatial variations in instantaneous fluxes and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and free carbon dioxide (CO2) are presented for a small acidic headwater stream in NE Scotland. Chloride is used as a conservative element to estimate additional, diffuse inputs of water into the main stem of the stream, other than those from tributaries. Downstream changes in instantaneous carbon fluxes were calculated and then used to estimate losses and gains of carbon within the stream system. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the stream ranged from 1.19-6.06 mg l-1 at its source to a maximum of 10.0-25.3 mg l-1 as the stream passed through deep peats; DOC concentrations then declined in the lower part of the catchment. DIC concentrations were initially low, increased to 1.5-3.0 mg l-1 and then decreased to 0.1-1.65 mg l-1 at the lowest site. Free CO2 concentrations increased from 0.35 mg l-1 at the stream source to 3.30 mg l-1 as the stream passed through the peat dominated area. Continually high inputs of CO2-rich water ({\textgreater}6.0 mg l-1) from tributaries maintained these high concentrations in the main stem, until approximately 1.74 km downstream, when there was a rapid decline in concentration. Significant changes in DOC, DIC and CO2 fluxes occur over a distance of 2.7 km downstream from the stream source to the catchment outlet. Between 5.64-41.5 mg C s-1 as DOC and 2.52-16.2 mg C s-1 as DIC are removed from the water column. Between 6.81 and 19.0 mg C s-1 as CO2 is lost along the stream length as progressive equilibration with the atmosphere occurs. We estimate that 11.6-17.6{\%} of the total DOC flux is removed from streamwater by in-stream processes. Dissolved inorganic carbon (HCO3- and free CO2) losses are in excess of nine times its measured flux at the outlet of the catchment. These results suggest that in-stream processing of DOC and DIC and outgassing of CO2 are important controls on the spatial variability of carbon fluxes within headwater streams in upland catchments dominated by organic-rich soils.

abstract = {Functional trait differences among species are increasingly used to infer the effects of biotic and abiotic processes on species coexistence. Commonly, the trait diversity observed within communities is compared to patterns simulated in randomly generated communities based on sampling within a region. The resulting patterns of trait convergence and divergence are assumed to reveal abiotic and biotic processes, respectively. However, biotic processes such as competition can produce both trait divergence and convergence, through either excluding similar species (niche differences, divergence) or excluding dissimilar species (weaker competitor exclusion, convergence). Hence, separating biotic and abiotic processes that can produce identical patterns of trait diversity, or even patterns that neutralize each other, is not feasible with previous methods. We propose an operational framework in which the functional trait dissimilarity within communities (FDcomm) is compared to the corresponding trait dissimilarity expected from the species pool (i.e., functional species pool diversity, FDpool). FDpool includes the set of potential species for a site delimited by the operating environmental and dispersal limitation filters. By applying these filters, the resulting pattern of trait diversity is consistent with biotic processes, i.e., trait divergence (FDcomm {\textgreater} FDpool) indicates niche differentiation, while trait convergence (FDcomm {\textless} FDpool) indicates weaker competitor exclusion. To illustrate this framework, with its potential application and constraints, we analyzed both simulated and field data. The functional species pool framework more consistently detected the simulated trait diversity patterns than previous approaches. In the field, using data from plant communities of typical Northern European habitats in Estonia, we found that both niche-based and weaker competitor exclusion influenced community assembly, depending on the traits and community considered. In both simulated and field data, we demonstrated that only by estimating the species pool of a site is it possible to differentiate the patterns of trait dissimilarity produced by operating biotic processes. The framework, which can be applied with both functional and phylogenetic diversity, enables a reinterpretation of community assembly processes. Solving the challenge of defining an appropriate reference species pool for a site can provide a better understanding of community assembly.},

abstract = {Relationships between traits of organisms and the structure of their metacommunities have so far mainly been explored with meta-analyses. We compared metacommunities of a wide variety of aquatic organism groups (12 groups, ranging from bacteria to fish) in the same set of 99 ponds to minimise biases inherent to meta-analyses. In the category of passive dispersers, large-bodied groups showed stronger spatial patterning than small-bodied groups suggesting an increasing impact of dispersal limitation with increasing body size. Metacommunities of organisms with the ability to fly (i.e. insect groups) showed a weaker imprint of dispersal limitation than passive dispersers with similar body size. In contrast, dispersal movements of vertebrate groups (fish and amphibians) seemed to be mainly confined to local connectivity patterns. Our results reveal that body size and dispersal mode are important drivers of metacommunity structure and these traits should therefore be considered when developing a predictive framework for metacommunity dynamics.},

abstract = {Adaptive radiation can be strongly influenced by interspecific competition for resources, which can lead to diverse outcomes ranging from competitive exclusion to character displacement. In each case, sympatric species are expected to evolve into distinct ecological niches, such as different food types, yet this expectation is not always met when such species are examined in nature. The most common hypotheses to account for the coexistence of species with substantial diet overlap rest on temporal variation in niches (often diets). Yet spatial variation in niche overlap might also be important, pointing to the need for spatiotemporal analyses of diet and diet overlap between closely related species persisting in sympatry. We here perform such an analysis by characterizing the diets of, and diet overlap among, four sympatric Darwin's ground finch species at three sites and over 5 years on a single Gal{\'{a}}pagos island (Santa Cruz). We find that the different species have broadly similar and overlapping diets - they are to some extent generalists and opportunists - yet we also find that each species retains some 'private' resources for which their morphologies are best suited. Importantly, use of these private resources increased considerably, and diet overlap decreased accordingly, when the availability of preferred shared foods, such as arthropods, was reduced during drought conditions. Spatial variation in food resources was also important. These results together suggest that the ground finches are 'imperfect generalists' that use overlapping resources under benign conditions (in space or time), but then retreat to resources for which they are best adapted during periods of food limitation. These conditions likely promote local and regional coexistence.},

abstract = {Classification and regression trees are ideally suited for the analysis of complex ecological data. For such data, we require flexible and robust analytical methods, which can deal with nonlinear relationships, high-order interactions, and missing values. Despite such difficulties, the methods should be simple to understand and give easily interpretable results. Trees explain variation of a single response variable by repeatedly splitting the data into more homogeneous groups, using combinations of explanatory variables that may be categorical and/or numeric. Each group is characterized by a typical value of the response variable, the number of observations in the group, and the values of the explanatory variables that define it. The tree is represented graphically, and this aids exploration and understanding. Trees can be used for interactive exploration and for description and prediction of patterns and processes. Advantages of trees include: (1) the flexibility to handle a broad range of response types, including numeric, categorical, ratings, and survival data; (2) invariance to monotonic transformations of the explanatory variables, (3) ease and robustness of construction; (4) ease of interpretation; and (5) the ability to handle missing values in both response and explanatory variables. Thus, trees complement or represent an alternative to many traditional statistical techniques, including multiple regression, analysis of variance, logistic regression, log-linear models, linear discriminant analysis, and survival models. We use classification and regression trees to analyze survey data from the Australian central Great Barrier Reef, comprising abundances of soft coral taxa (Cnidaria: Octocorallia) and physical and spatial environmental information. Regression tree analyses showed that dense aggregations, typically formed by three taxa, were restricted to distinct habitat types, each of which was defined by combinations of 3-4 environmental variables. The habitat definitions were consistent with known experimental findings on the nutrition of these tars. When used separately, physical and spatial variables were similarly strong predictors of abundances and lost little in comparison with their joint use. The spatial variables are thus effective surrogates for the physical variables in this extensive reef complex, where information on the physical environment is often not available. Finally, we compare the use of regression trees and linear models for the analysis of these data and show how Linear models fail to find patterns uncovered by the trees.},

Inclusion of such variation is important for continued progress in ecological and evolutionary theory. We provide a conceptual basis for IBMs by describing five major types of individual variation in IBMs: spatial, ontogenetic, phenotypic, cognitive, and genetic. IBMs are now used in almost all subfields of ecology and evolutionary biology. We map those subfields and look more closely at selected key papers on fish recruitment, forest dynamics, sympatric speciation, metapopulation dynamics, maintenance of diversity, and species conservation. Theorists are currently divided on whether IBMs represent only a practical tool for extending classical theory to more complex situations, or whether individual-based theory represents a radically new research program. We feel that the tension between these two poles of thinking can be a source of creativity in ecology and evolutionary theory.},

We studied micro-evolutionary responses of a herbivorous rotifer to P-limited food and the potential consequences for its population demography and for ecosystem properties. We subjected field-derived, replicate rotifer populations to P-deficient and P-replete algal food, and studied adaptation in common garden transplant experiments after 103 and 209 days of selection. When fed P-limited food, populations with a P-limitation selection history suffered 37{\%} lower mortality, reached twice the steady state biomass, and reduced algae by 40{\%} compared to populations with a P-replete selection history. Adaptation involved no change in rotifer elemental composition but reduced investment in sex. This study demonstrates potentially strong eco-evolutionary feedbacks from shifting elemental balances to ecosystem properties, including grazing pressure and the ratio of grazer:producer biomass.},

abstract = {PLANKTONIC bacteria are a fundamental component of the organic carbon cycle in aquatic systems(1). Organic carbon consumption by planktonic bacteria is the sum of bacterial production (BP) and bacterial respiration (BR), IL is now estimated that. 30-60{\%} of phytoplankton production (the amount of inorganic carbon fixed by phytoplankton photosynthesis, corrected far phytoplankton respiration) in marine and freshwater systems is processed by bacterial(1-3). These estimates of carbon flow through bacteria are conservative, however, because losses due to bacterial respiration are seldom directly measured(4,5). We report here that bacterial respiration is generally high, and tends to exceed phytoplankton net production in unproductive systems (less than 70 to 120 mu g carbon per litre per day). A large proportion of the world's aquatic systems have phytoplankton productivities below this value(6). Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) is the result of BP and BR[BGE = BP/(BR + BP)]. Comparisons of our models of bacterial respiration with published models of bacterial secondary production(1,7) show that bacterial growth efficiency must range fi om less than 10{\%} to 25{\%} in most freshwater and marine systems, well below the values commonly assumed in many current ecological models(1,2,8,9). The imbalance between bacterial respiration and phytoplankton production suggests that in unproductive aquatic systems, the biological system is a net source of CO2.},

abstract = {The organic carbon consumed by aquatic bacteria (BCC) is partitioned between bacterial production (BP) and respiration (BR), but the factors that determine BCC and its partition into BP and BR are not well understood. We explored the coupling between BR, BR and BCC, and their links to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient availability in natural and restored tidal marshes and in the adjoining waters of Delaware Bay estuary. Labile DOC (LDOC) ranged from 3{\%} to 22{\%} of the DOC pool, and explained more of the variance in both BR and BCC than did bulk DOC. Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) was highly variable (0.09-0.58), and natural Spartina alterniflora marshes had consistently higher BGE than both restoration marshes and tidal floodwaters. BGE was negatively related to the ratio of LDOC to total dissolved phosphorous, which was highest in natural marshes. The enhancement of BP observed in the marshes relative to the estuarine floodwaters had different origins: In natural marshes it was mostly due to increases in BGE, whereas in restored marshes it followed increased BCC. These results highlight the importance of P in regulating microbial metabolism in coastal areas, and the need to understand the pathways that lead to BP in these systems.},

abstract = {It is generally recognized that a fraction of all bacterioplankton cells enumerated using conventional epifluorescence techniques is neither growing, dividing nor metabolically active, but the variation in the proportion of active cells among aquatic systems is not well understood. Here, we hypothesize that the proportion of metabolically active cells increases systematically along gradients of enrichment, and to test this hypothesis the number and proportion of metabolically active planktonic bacteria were investigated during the summer in a set of 24 temperate lakes, which span a considerable range in productivity. The tetrazolium salt 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) was used as an indicator of cells with an active electron transport system. The total number of bacteria ranged from 1.88x106 to 7.70x106 ml-1, whereas the number of active cells was more variable and ranged from 0.37x106 to 2.18x106 ml-1 in the study lakes. The proportion of metabolically active cells ranged from 15 to 33{\%}, and tended to increase with nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations, but not with dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Data on the number of total and active bacteria culled from the literature for marine, estuarine and freshwater systems show that the trends we measured in lakes are valid for pelagic systems in general. Over a broad range of aquatic systems, the total number of bacteria varied by three orders of magnitude, whereas the number of active bacteria varied by four orders of magnitude as system productivity increased. The proportion of active cells increased from ultraoligotrophic openocean areas ({\textless}5{\%}) to highly productive estuaries ({\textgreater}50{\%}). Our results suggest that in most aquatic systems there is a pool of rapidly growmg cells, embedded in a usually larger matrix of inactive bacteria, and that the relative size of the active and inactive pools varies systematically among bacterial populations along gradients of enrichment.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT ganic matter: They produce new bacterial biomass (bacterial secondary produc- tion [B1P]), Heterotrophic bacteria perform two major functions in the transformation and they respire organic C to inorganic C (bacterial respiration [BR]). For planktonic bacteria, a great deal has been learned about BP and its regulation during the past several decades but far less has been learned about BR. Our lack of knowledge about BR limits our ability to understand the role of bacteria in the carbon cycle of aquatic ecosystems. Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) is the amount of new bacterial biomass produced per unit of organic C substrate assim- ilated and is a way to relate BP and BR: BGE = (BP)/(BP + BR). Estimates of BGE for natural planktonic bacteria range from {\textless}0.05 to as high as 0.6, but little is known about what might regulate this enormous range. In this paper we review the physiological and ecological bases of the regulation of BGE. Further, we assemble the literature of the past 30 years for which both BP and BR were measured in natural planktonic ecosystems and explore the relationship between BGE and BP. Although the relationship is variable, BGE varies systematically with BP and the trophic richness of the ecosystem. In the most dilute, oligotrophic systems, BGE is as low as 0.01; in the most eutrophic systems, it plateaus near 0.5. Planktonic bacteria appear to maximize carbon utilization rather than BGE. A consequence of this strategy is that maintenance energy costs (and therefore maintenance respiration) seems to be highest in oligotrophic systems. of or-},

abstract = {A series of dialysis experiments was performed to study the relative importance of substrate Limitation and grazing in controlling the proportion of active cells of coastal marine bacterioplankton. The grazer community was manipulated by filling dialysis bags with unfiltered water and water serially passed through 150-, 40-, and 0.8-mu m pore-size filters. The total number of bacteria, the number of metabolically active cells, bacterial loss rates, and the abundances of heterotrophic nanoflagellates were measured immediately and at 3 and 6 d. Gross growth rates were similar in all treatments, suggesting that ambient nutrient concentrations set an upper limit to the maximum growth rates, whereas grazing determined the net growth rates and the final number of bacteria. Bacterial loss rates, measured as the disappearance of fluorescently labeled minicells, correlated well with the initial density of heterotrophic nanoflagellates in the different treatments. The number of active cells at the end of the experiments varied widely among treatments and reached 2.0 x 10(6) ml(-1), or over 55{\%} of the total final density in dialysis bags, with little or no grazing by nanoflagellates. The final proportion of active cells was negatively correlated to both the loss rates and the initial nanoflagellate density, and it was estimated that grazing rates on metabolically active bacteria were four or more times higher than those on inactive bacteria. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates thus seemed to control bacterial density by skimming newly growing cells rather than by cropping the standing stock of bacteria.},

abstract = {The composition and prevalence of microorganisms in the middle-to-upper troposphere (8-15 km altitude) and their role in aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions represent important, unresolved questions for biological and atmospheric science. In particular, airborne microorganisms above the oceans remain essentially uncharacterized, as most work to date is restricted to samples taken near the Earth's surface. Here we report on the microbiome of low- and high-altitude air masses sampled onboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration DC-8 platform during the 2010 Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes campaign in the Caribbean Sea. The samples were collected in cloudy and cloud-free air masses before, during, and after two major tropical hurricanes, Earl and Karl. Quantitative PCR and microscopy revealed that viable bacterial cells represented on average around 20{\%} of the total particles in the 0.25- to 1-$\mu$m diameter range and were at least an order of magnitude more abundant than fungal cells, suggesting that bacteria represent an important and underestimated fraction of micrometer-sized atmospheric aerosols. The samples from the two hurricanes were characterized by significantly different bacterial communities, revealing that hurricanes aerosolize a large amount of new cells. Nonetheless, 17 bacterial taxa, including taxa that are known to use C1-C4 carbon compounds present in the atmosphere, were found in all samples, indicating that these organisms possess traits that allow survival in the troposphere. The findings presented here suggest that the microbiome is a dynamic and underappreciated aspect of the upper troposphere with potentially important impacts on the hydrological cycle, clouds, and climate.},

abstract = {Environmental temperature has systematic effects on rates of species interactions, primarily through its influence on organismal physiology. We present a mechanistic model for the thermal response of consumer-resource interactions. We focus on how temperature affects species interactions via key traits - body velocity, detection distance, search rate and handling time - that underlie per capita consumption rate. The model is general because it applies to all foraging strategies: active-capture (both consumer and resource body velocity are important), sit-and-wait (resource velocity dominates) and grazing (consumer velocity dominates). The model predicts that temperature influences consumer-resource interactions primarily through its effects on body velocity (either of the consumer, resource or both), which determines how often consumers and resources encounter each other, and that asymmetries in the thermal responses of interacting species can introduce qualitative, not just quantitative, changes in consumer-resource dynamics. We illustrate this by showing how asymmetries in thermal responses determine equilibrium population densities in interacting consumer-resource pairs. We test for the existence of asymmetries in consumer-resource thermal responses by analysing an extensive database on thermal response curves of ecological traits for 309 species spanning 15 orders of magnitude in body size from terrestrial, marine and freshwater habitats. We find that asymmetries in consumer-resource thermal responses are likely to be a common occurrence. Overall, our study reveals the importance of asymmetric thermal responses in consumer-resource dynamics. In particular, we identify three general types of asymmetries: (i) different levels of performance of the response, (ii) different rates of response (e.g. activation energies) and (iii) different peak or optimal temperatures. Such asymmetries should occur more frequently as the climate changes and species' geographical distributions and phenologies are altered, such that previously noninteracting species come into contact. 6. By using characteristics of trophic interactions that are often well known, such as body size, foraging strategy, thermy and environmental temperature, our framework should allow more accurate predictions about the thermal dependence of consumer-resource interactions. Ultimately, integration of our theory into models of food web and ecosystem dynamics should be useful in understanding how natural systems will respond to current and future temperature change.},

@article{DenBoer1968,
abstract = {Variation within natural populations as well as in their environments may result naturally in a spreading (diminution) of the risk of extinction to which these populations are exposed under the influence of variable environmental factors. Different ways of spreading of the risk can be distinguished: 1. Spreading of risk by phenotypic variation. 2. Spreading of risk in time: variation between individuals in time and rate of development and/or reproduction. 3. Spreading of risk in space: the effect of extreme conditions in one place will be levelled out to some degree by less extreme conditions in others. Migration can contribute to the levelling influence of spatial heterogeneity. The smaller the area inhabited by a population or species the lower the spatial heterogeneity and the greater the risk of extinction will be. 4. Spreading of risk in relations with other species: e.g. polyphagy, more than one predator (parasite) species to a prey, hyperpredation, hyperparasitism, phenotypic and developmental variation in preys and enemies, and spatial heterogeneity in their environments. The different ways in which the risk is spread are intricate, and may contribute to a relative reduction in the amplitude of fluctuations in animal numbers. The chance of survival of a population is determined by the pattern and magnitude of its fluctuations. On this basis, a hypo- thesis is posed: density fluctuations in natural populations are stabilized to some degree by spreading of risk, or, in other words, by the number of factors influencing density. In a natural (heterogeneous) population in a natural (heterogeneous) environment, density-dependent and other significant density-dependent influences can be expected mainly under rather homogeneous conditions. No population can continue to increase in numbers in a limited environment. Such limitation of density does not necessarily influence the magnitude of density fluctuations but mainly shifts them to a lower density level, thus increasing the risk of extinction. Spreading of the risk, on the contrary, has the same levelling influence on high as on low densities, and can be operative in sparse as well as in dense populations. It is supposed that the stabilization of animal numbers in natural populations is established by spreading of the risk, incidentally supple- mented by some kind of density limitation. The "balance of nature" must be the result of a complex and highly intricate "system" of spreading of the risk within populations and between populations of the same and especially of different species.},

abstract = {To assess which dispersal strategies are favored by natural selection, the potential of invasion by mutant (or immigrant) strategies into populations of resident dispersal strategists can be investigated. Such evolutionary invasion analyses are best based on the population dynamics between mutant and resident individuals. If the initial growth rate of a rare mutant within a given resident population is positive, the mutant can invade and typically replace the former resident. Repeated substitutions of this kind can take populations to a dispersal strategy (or to a polymorphism thereof) that is 'unbeatable' or 'evolutionarily stable'5. The theory of adaptive dynamics123 allows us to predict the resulting evolutionary change in continuous adaptive traits such as dispersal rates. Also, contingent dispersal strategies can be investigated, such as probabilities of dispersing from or into subpopulations of given densities, or dispersal rates that are dependent on age. How a model metapopulation is invaded by a new dispersal strategy is shown by the sequence of illustrations below. Each graph depicts the frequency distribution of patches inhabited by n resident and m mutant individuals. Within-patch dynamics are individual-based and logistic, and the rate of dispersal between patches is adaptive. Initially mutant strategists are few and far between, but they eventually take over the entire population. Using knowledge of population dynamics to predict success or failure of such invasions gives a theory for the evolution of dispersal that is firmly rooted in descriptions of ecological change.},

abstract = {Predicting the effects of climate change and atmospheric deposition on water quality requires predicting the effects of landscape form on export of substances downstream. In this paper, we present dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total phosphorus (TP), and iron (Fe) export data (1980-1992) for 20 relatively undisturbed, forested catchments draining into seven lakes in central Ontario and develop regression models of chemical export as functions of landscape composition. The extent of wetlands was correlated with export of DOC and TP; the proportion of the catchment covered by peatlands accounted for 78{\%} of the variance in a regression model of long-term average DOC export and 76{\%} of the variance in a model of color "export." Peatland coverage and Fe export together explained 76{\%} of the variance in a long-term average TP export model, which is consistent with published experimental evidence that Fe facilitates P complexation with DOC in surface waters. The long-term average Fe export model was not significant when all 20 catchments were included. However, Fe export from the 14 catchments with thin tills was a function only of peatland coverage (R 2 -- 0.71), suggesting that Fe export is dependent to a large extent upon either the export of organic material or the reducing conditions. The long-term export models worked well when export of a substance was dominated by peatlands but was not very sensitive to the influence of mineral soils. The long-term average TP/DOC ratio was remarkably constant among most whole-lake catchments, ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 mg P/g C, the exception being the catchment of anthropogenically acidified Plastic Lake with a ratio of 0.8. Fe export to Plastic lake was also enriched relative to TP export compared with the other lakes. Therefore TP export to Plastic Lake may be limited by some mechanism related to acidification.},

abstract = {In this article, we explain an often overlooked process that may significantly contribute to positive correlations between measures of species diversity and community stability. Empirical studies showing positive stability-diversity relationships have, for the most part, used a single class of stability (or, more accurately, instability) measures: the temporal variation in aggregate community properties such as biomass or productivity. We show that for these measures, stability will essentially always rise with species diversity because of the statistical averaging of the fluctuations in species' abundances. This simple probabilistic process will operate in the absence of any strong species interactions, although its strength is driven by the relative abundances of species, as well as by the existence of positive or negative correlations in the fluctuations of species. To explore the possible importance of this effect in real communities, we fit a simple simulation model to Tilman's grassland community. Our results indicate that statistical averaging might play a substantial role in explaining stability-diversity correlations for this and other systems. Models of statistical averaging can serve as a useful baseline for predictions of community stability, to which the influences of both negative and positive species interactions may then be added and tested.},

abstract = {To persist, species are expected to shift their geographical ranges polewards or to higher elevations as the Earth's climate warms. However, although many species' ranges have shifted in historical times, many others have not, or have shifted only at the high-latitude or high-elevation limits, leading to range expansions rather than contractions. Given these idiosyncratic responses to climate warming, and their varied implications for species' vulnerability to climate change, a critical task is to understand why some species have not shifted their ranges, particularly at the equatorial or low-elevation limits, and whether such resilience will last as warming continues. Here we show that compensatory changes in demographic rates are buffering southern populations of two North American tundra plants against the negative effects of a warming climate, slowing their northward range shifts, but that this buffering is unlikely to continue indefinitely. Southern populations of both species showed lower survival and recruitment but higher growth of individual plants, possibly owing to longer, warmer growing seasons. Because of these and other compensatory changes, the population growth rates of southern populations are not at present lower than those of northern ones. However, continued warming may yet prove detrimental, as most demographic rates that improved in moderately warmer years declined in the warmest years, with the potential to drive future population declines. Our results emphasize the need for long-term, range-wide measurement of all population processes to detect demographic compensation and to identify nonlinear responses that may lead to sudden range shifts as climatic tipping points are exceeded.},

abstract = {Abstract We propose the Stream Biome Gradient Concept as a way to predict macroscale biological patterns in streams. This concept is based on the hypothesis that many abiotic and biotic features of streams change predictably along climate (temperature and precipitation) gradients because of direct influences of climate on hydrology, geomorphology, and interactions mediated by terrestrial vegetation. The Stream Biome Gradient Concept generates testable hypotheses related to continental variation among streams worldwide and allows aquatic scientists to understand how results from one biome might apply to a less-studied biome. Some predicted factors change monotonically across the biome/climate gradients, whereas others have maxima or minima in the central portion of the gradient. For example, predictions across the gradient from drier deserts through grasslands to wetter forests include more permanent flow, less bare ground, lower erosion and sediment transport rates, decreased importance of autochthonous C inputs to food webs, and greater stream animal species richness. In contrast, effects of large ungulate grazers on streams are expected to be greater in grasslands than in forests or deserts, and fire is expected to have weaker effects in grassland streams than in desert and forest streams along biome gradients with changing precipitation and constant latitude or elevation. Understanding historic patterns among biomes can help describe the evolutionary template at relevant biogeographic scales, can be used to broaden other conceptual models of stream ecology, and could lead to better management and conservation across the broadest scales.

abstract = {Mixing and asynchrony of interactions can be expected to stabilize the dynamics of populations. One way such mixing occurs is by dispersal, and Hastings and Gyllenberg et al. have shown that symmetric dispersal between two local populations governed by logistic difference equations can simplify the dynamics. These results are extended here by using a more flexible difference equation and allowing asymmetric dispersal. Although there are some instances where dispersal is destabilizing, its stabilizing effect is enhanced by asymmetry. In addition, very high dispersal rates can induce a stable equilibrium of the metapopulation despite highly chaotic local dynamics. If this equilibrium loses stability, the route to intermittent chaos can be observed. Two new conditions under which dispersal can be stabilizing are discussed. One occurs when the timing of reproduction and dispersal differs in the two patches of the metapopulation. This enlarges the asynchrony of the interactions, and simple dynamics due to dispersal are more likely. The second works by slightly adjusting dispersal rates to control chaotic dynamics. The control can replace chaos by a stable equilibrium. The evolution of dispersal rates is discussed. Since obtaining general criteria for invasion into a population with chaotic dynamics is difficult, no clear conclusions are possible as to whether evolution leads to more stable metapopulations. However, a mutant that controls chaos can invade a resident having the same local dynamics but no control mechanism, so that evolution can lead from chaos to a stable equilibrium.},

At the regional scale, we investigated a 29-km-long, expanding and contracting, losing (average flow decrease 2.5m3 s21 km21) and a 12.5-km-long, stable, gaining (average increase 0.3 m3 s21 km21) reach. At the local scale, we sampled riffle head and riffle tail units nested within the losing and gaining reaches. At the regional scale, we characterized vertical exchange by strong downwelling (negative vertical hydraulic gradient; VHG) in the losing and moderate upwelling (positive VHG) in the gaining reach. Nutrients, such as NO3-N and dissolved N (DN), and periphyton biomass (AFDM) showed a significantly (p , 0.05) lower concentration in the losing than in the gaining reach. A contrasting pattern emerged for sediment respiration. Expansion and contraction dynamics (i.e., drying and rewetting) in the losing reach negatively affected chlorophyll a and AFDM. At the local scale, VHG was negative at riffle heads and positive at riffle tails nested in the gaining reach, but variables did not respond to vertical exchange at riffle heads and riffle tails in the losing or gaining reach. However, averaged data from riffle heads and riffle tails in the losing reach compared to averaged data for riffle heads and riffle tails in the gaining reach showed the same pattern as found in the regional investigation. Vertical exchange was apparently a major factor influencing ecosystem properties and ecosystem processes hierarchically across different spatial scales.},

abstract = {Patterns of b diversity are commonly used to infer underlying ecological processes. In this study we examined the effect of spatial configuration of habitat capacity on different metrics of b diversity i.e., b diversity measured as turnover and as variation. For b diversity as turnover, a monotonic species spatial turnover pattern is typically considered as a benchmark for species distributions driven only by dispersal process. Deviations from a monotonic curve are attributed to local environmental filtering (i.e., the same environmental factors affecting different species differently). However, we found non-monotonicity in species spatial turnover in models without environmental filtering effect. This non-monotonicity was caused by variation in a diversity, introduced by spatial configuration of habitat capacity. After applying a recent null-model approach-designed to tease out the effect of variation in a diversity-species spatial turnover remained non-monotonic. This non-monotonicity makes it problematic to use species spatial turnover to infer the underlying processes for species distribution, i.e., whether it is driven by environmental filtering or dispersal processes. Spatial configuration of habitat capacity also influences landscape connectivity. Small-habitat capacity sites may constrain movements of organisms (i.e., dispersal) between sites supporting high capacity habitats. We showed that in a landscape where small-habitat capacity sites were located in positions important for dispersal (e.g., in the center as opposed to on the edge of a landscape) has a higher spatial variation of species composition, hence, higher b diversity. Ecologists who use different measures of b diversity should be aware of these effects introduced by spatial configuration of habitat capacity.},

abstract = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of species' distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing spatial autocorrelation in the errors. However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix.},

abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the 'folk lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of |r| {\textgreater}0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.

abstract = {The extent to which biodiversity change in local assemblages contributes to global biodiversity loss is poorly understood. We analyzed 100 time series from biomes across Earth to ask how diversity within assemblages is changing through time. We quantified patterns of temporal $\alpha$ diversity, measured as change in local diversity, and temporal $\beta$ diversity, measured as change in community composition. Contrary to our expectations, we did not detect systematic loss of $\alpha$ diversity. However, community composition changed systematically through time, in excess of predictions from null models. Heterogeneous rates of environmental change, species range shifts associated with climate change, and biotic homogenization may explain the different patterns of temporal $\alpha$ and $\beta$ diversity. Monitoring and understanding change in species composition should be a conservation priority.},

abstract = {It is suggested that diversity destabilizes individual populations within communities; however, generalizations are problematic because effects of diversity can be confounded by variation attributable to community type, life history or successional stage. We examined these complexities using a 40-year record of reassembly in forest herb communities in two clearcut watersheds in the Andrews Long-term Ecological Research Site (Oregon, USA). Population stability was higher among forest than colonizing species and increased with successional stage. Thus, life history and successional stage may explain some of the variability in diversity-stability relationships found previously. However, population stability was positively related to diversity and this relationship held for different forest communities, for species with contrasting life histories, and for different successional stages. Positive relationships between diversity and population stability can arise if diversity has facilitative effects, or if stability is a precursor, rather than a response, to diversity.},

abstract = {Biodiversity has been shown to increase the temporal stability of community and ecosystem attributes through multiple mechanisms, but these same mechanisms make less consistent predictions about the effects of richness on population stability. The overall effects of biodiversity on population and community stability will therefore depend on the dominant mechanisms that are likely to vary with the nature of biodiversity loss and the degree of environmental variability. We conducted a mesocosm experiment in which we generated a gradient in zooplankton species richness by directly manipulating dominant species and by allowing/preventing immigration from a metacommunity. The mesocosms were maintained under either constant or variable nutrient environments. Population, community, and ecosystem data were collected for five months. We found that zooplankton population and community stability is enhanced in species-rich communities in both constant and variable environments. Species richness increased primarily through the addition of species with low abundance. The communities that were connected to a metacommunity via immigration were the most diverse and the most stable, indicating the importance of both metacommunity dynamics and rare species for stability. We found little evidence for selection effects or overyielding as stabilizing forces. We did find support for asynchronous dynamics and statistical averaging, both of which predict destabilizing effects at the population level. We also found support for weak interactions, which predicts that both populations and communities will become more stable as richness increases. In order to understand the effects of biodiversity loss on stability, we will need to understand when different stabilizing mechanisms tend to operate but also how multiple mechanisms interact.},

abstract = {The temporal stability of aggregate community and ecosystem properties is influenced by the variability of component populations, the interactions among populations, and the influence of environmental fluctuations on populations. Environmental fluctuations that enhance population variability are generally expected to destabilize community and ecosystem properties, but this will depend on the degree to which populations are synchronized in their dynamics. Here we use seminatural experimental ponds to show that reduced synchrony among zooplankton taxa increases the temporal stability of zooplankton density, abundance, and ecosystem productivity in fluctuating environments. However, asynchrony only occurs at long timescales (;80-day periods) and under recurring environmental perturbations. At shorter timescales (;10-day periods) and in constant environments, synchronous dynamics dominate. Our findings support recent theory indicating that compensatory dynamics can stabilize communities and ecosystems. They further indicate that environmental fluctuations can enhance the likelihood of long-period asynchrony and thus stabilize community and ecosystem properties despite their short term destabilizing effects.},

abstract = {Resolving current concerns about the role of biodiversity on ecosystems calls for understanding the separate roles of changes in species numbers and of composition. Recent work shows that primary productivity often, but not always, saturates with species richness within single trophic levels. However, any interpretation of such patterns must consider that variation in biodiversity is necessarily associated with changes in species composition (identity), and that changes in biodiversity often occur across multiple trophic levels. Here we present results from a mesocosm experiment in which we independently manipulated species richness and species composition across multiple trophic levels in pond food webs. In contrast to previous studies that focused on single trophic levels, we found that productivity is either idiosyncratic or increases with respect to species richness, and that richness influences trophic structure. However, the composition of species within richness levels can have equally or more marked effects on ecosystems than average effects of richness per se. Indirect evidence suggests that richness and associated changes in species composition affect ecosystem attributes through indirect effects and trophic interactions among species, features that are highly characteristic of natural, complex ecosystems.},

abstract = {We compared the relative influences of biochemical uptake processes and dynamic hydrology and geomorphology (hydrogeomorphology) on molybdate reactive phosphorus (MRP) retention within a stream. MRP concentrations were measured upstream and downstream of a 4.5-km reach undergoing dynamic channel adjustment in response to downstream dam removal. Geomorphic adjustments following removal produced measurable changes in velocity and depth, and decreases in MRP retention. Paired upstream and downstream measurements of MRP concentration were used to compute three retention metrics: uptake rate, mass transfer coefficient, and uptake length, which were used as model parameters. Modeling results showed that changes in channel morphology alone following dam removal could result in an approximate 40{\%} increase in downstream MRP concentrations compared with conditions with the dam in place. However, empirical and modeling results indicate that hydrogeomorphology can control nutrient retention on the reach scale only when uptake processes are either sufficiently great or when uptake rates have limited variability. Review of published phosphorus retention values revealed greater variability in biochemical uptake rates than in hydrogeomorphology. Thus uptake rates should exert a stronger control on reach-scale MRP retention than changing channel morphology or hydrology. These results suggest that maintaining or restoring channel conditions that are conducive to biochemical uptake are of greater priority than restoration of hydrologic or geomorphic conditions alone.},

Despite the enormous attention given to SAR in the form of many individual analyses, little attempt has been made to synthesize these studies. We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of 794 SAR, comprising a wide span of organisms, habitats and locations. We identified factors reflecting both pattern-based and dynamic approaches to SAR and tested whether these factors leave significant imprints on the slope and strength of SAR. Our analysis revealed that SAR are significantly affected by variables characterizing the sampling scheme, the spatial scale, and the types of organisms or habitats involved. We found that steeper SAR are generated at lower latitudes and by larger organisms. SAR varied significantly between nested and independent sampling schemes and between major ecosystem types, but not generally between the terrestrial and the aquatic realm. Both the fit and the slope of the SAR were scale-dependent. We conclude that factors dynamically regulating species richness at different spatial scales strongly affect the shape of SAR. We highlight important consequences of this systematic variation in SAR for ecological theory, conservation management and extinction risk predictions.},

The second approach seeks to understand organization by considering the production of the extant community state. This is as a question of the dynamics or development of an organizing system. The expression of ecological mechanisms is constrained by the sequence of community states which regulate the production of community pattern.

Hence the composition of species assemblages is an integrative response variable, and its variability can be explained by the complex interplay among several structuring factors. The thorough analysis of spatial variation in species assemblages may help infer processes shaping ecological communities. We suggest that ecological studies would benefit from the combined use of the classical statistical models of community composition data, such as constrained or unconstrained multivariate analyses of site-by-species abundance tables, with rapidly emerging and diversifying methods of spatial pattern analysis. Doing so allows one to deal with spatially explicit ecological models of beta diversity in a biogeographic context through the multiscale analysis of spatial patterns in original species data tables, including spatial characterization of fitted or residual variation from environmental models. We summarize here the recent progress for specifying spatial features through spatial weighting matrices and spatial eigenfunctions in order to define spatially constrained or scale-explicit multivariate analyses. Through a worked example on tropical tree communities, we also show the potential of the overall approach to identify significant residual spatial patterns that could arise from the omission of important unmeasured explanatory variables or processes.},

In order to assess the importance of these two sources, spatial relationships must be explicitly introduced into statistical models. Recently, a new approach called principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) has been proposed to create spatial predictors that can be easily incorporated into regression or canonical analysis models, providing a flexible tool especially when contrasted to the family of autoregressive models and trend surface analysis, which are of common use in ecological and geographical analysis. In this paper, we explore the theory of the PCNM approach and demonstrate how it is linked to spatial autocorrelation structure functions. The method basically consists of diagonalizing a spatial weighting matrix, then extracting the eigenvectors that maximize the Moran's index of autocorrelation. These eigenvectors can then be used directly as explanatory variables in regression or canonical models. We propose improvements and extensions of the original method, and illustrate them with examples that will help ecologists choose the variant that will better suit their needs.},

A proteinacious shell, called the coat, encases the spore and plays a major role in spore survival. The coat is composed of over 25 polypeptide species, organized into several morphologically distinct layers. The mechanisms that guide coat assembly have been largely unknown until recently. We now know that proper formation of the coat relies on the genetic program that guides the synthesis of spore components during development as well as on morphogenetic proteins dedicated to coat assembly. Over 20 structural and morphogenetic genes have been cloned. In this review, we consider the contributions of the known coat and morphogenetic proteins to coat function and assembly. We present a model that describes how morphogenetic proteins direct coat assembly to the specific subcellular site of the nascent spore surface and how they establish the coat layers. We also discuss the importance of posttranslational processing of coat proteins in coat morphogenesis. Finally, we review some of the major outstanding questions in the field.},

The best predictor of evolutionary rate is expression level, for reasons that have remained unexplained. Here, we hypothesize that selection to reduce the burden of protein misfolding will favor protein sequences with increased robustness to translational missense errors. Pressure for translational robustness increases with expression level and constrains sequence evolution. Using several sequenced yeast genomes, global expression and protein abundance data, and sets of paralogs traceable to an ancient whole-genome duplication in yeast, we rule out several confounding effects and show that expression level explains roughly half the variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein evolutionary rates. We examine causes for expression's dominant role and find that genome-wide tests favor the translational robustness explanation over existing hypotheses that invoke constraints on function or translational efficiency. Our results suggest that proteins evolve at rates largely unrelated to their functions and can explain why highly expressed proteins evolve slowly across the tree of life.},

abstract = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action - 'Water for Life' - 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01{\%} of the World's water and approximately 0.8{\%} of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100000 species out of approximately 1.8 million - almost 6{\%} of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the 'Water for Life' decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as 'receivers' of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed 'reconciliation ecology'.},

abstract = {Denitrification was assayed by the acetylene blockage technique in hyporheic sediments. Samples were obtained along transects perpindicular to the stream at two sites: (1) the base of a slope dominated by old-growth redwood and (2) the base of a slope dominated by alder regenerating from a clearcut in 1965. Denitrification was evident at in situ nitrate concentrations at all locations tested. Activity was stimulated by nitrate but nitrate plus glucose had no additional effect. Denitrifying potentials increased expected in equilibrium with the atmosphere in water obtained from monitoring wells immediately adjacent to the stream but was as low as 7{\%} of the expected value in water 11.4 m inland. Both nitrate and dissolved organic carbon decreased over summer in wells at the base of the alder-forested slope. A 48-h injection of nitrate-amended stream water into hyporheic water 8.4 m inland stimulated nitrous oxide production in the presence of acetylene. Nitrous oxide was generated as nitrate and acetylene were co-transported to a well 13 m down-gradient. The acetylene-block experiments coupled with the chemistry data suggest that denitrification can modify the chemistry of water during passage through the hyporheic zone.},

abstract = {Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of ecosystems requires integrating diversity within trophic levels (horizontal diversity) and across trophic levels (vertical diversity, including food chain length and omnivory). We review theoretical and experimental progress toward this goal. Generally, experiments show that biomass and resource use increase similarly with horizontal diversity of either producers or consumers. Among prey, higher diversity often increases resistance to predation, due to increased probability of including inedible species and reduced efficiency of specialist predators confronted with diverse prey. Among predators, changing diversity can cascade to affect plant biomass, but the strength and sign of this effect depend on the degree of omnivory and prey behaviour. Horizontal and vertical diversity also interact: adding a trophic level can qualitatively change diversity effects at adjacent levels. Multitrophic interactions produce a richer variety of diversity-functioning relationships than the monotonic changes predicted for single trophic levels. This complexity depends on the degree of consumer dietary generalism, trade-offs between competitive ability and resistance to predation, intraguild predation and openness to migration. Although complementarity and selection effects occur in both animals and plants, few studies have conclusively documented the mechanisms mediating diversity effects. Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of complex ecosystems will benefit from integrating theory and experiments with simulations and network-based approaches.},

abstract = {Concepts of spatial scale, such as extent, grain, resolution, range, footprint, support and cartographic ratio are not interchangeable. Because of the potential confusion among the definitions of these terms, we suggest that authors avoid the term ‘‘scale'' and instead refer to specific concepts. In particular, we are careful to discriminate between observation scales, scales of ecological phenomena and scales used in spatial statistical analysis. When scales of observation or analysis change, that is, when the unit size, shape, spacing or extent are altered, statistical results are expected to change. The kinds of results that may change include estimates of the population mean and variance, the strength and character of spatial autocorrelation and spatial anisotropy, patch and gap sizes and multivariate relationships. The first three of these results (precision of the mean, variance and spatial autocorrelation) can sometimes be estimated using geostatistical support-effect models. We present four case studies of organism abundance and cover illustrating some of these changes and how conclu- sions about ecological phenomena (process and structure) may be affected. We identify the influence of observational scale on statistical results as a subset of what geographers call the Modifiable Area Unit Problem (MAUP). The way to avoid the MAUP is by careful construction of sampling design and analysis. We recommend a set of considerations for sampling design to allow useful tests for specific scales of a phenomenon under study. We further recommend that ecological studies completely report all components of observation and analysis scales to increase the possibility of cross-study comparisons.},

abstract = {Networks from a wide range of physical, biological, and social systems have been recently described as ‘‘small-world'' and ‘‘scale- free.'' However, studies disagree whether ecological networks called food webs possess the characteristic path lengths, clustering coefficients, and degree distributions required for membership in these classes of networks. Our analysis suggests that the disagree- ments are based on selective use of relatively few food webs, as well as analytical decisions that obscure important variability in the data.Weanalyze a broad range of 16 high-quality food webs, with 25–172 nodes, from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Food webs generally have much higher complexity, measured as connectance (the fraction of all possible links that are realized in a network), and much smaller size than other networks studied, which have important implications for network topology. Our results resolve prior conflicts by demonstrating that althoughsome food webs have small-world and scale-free structure, most do not if they exceed a relatively low level of connectance. Although food-web degree distributions do not display a universal func- tional form, observed distributions are systematically related to network connectance and size. Also, although food webs often lack small-world structure because of low clustering, we identify a continuum of real-world networks including food webs whose ratios of observed to random clustering coefficients increase as a power–law function of network size over 7 orders of magnitude. Although food webs are generally not small-world, scale-free networks, food-web topology is consistent with patterns found within those classes of networks.},

abstract = {Patchiness plays a fundamental role in phytoplankton ecology by dictating the rate at which individual cells encounter each other and their predators. The distribution of motile phytoplankton species is often considerably more patchy than that of non-motile species at submetre length scales, yet the mechanism generating this patchiness has remained unknown. Here we show that strong patchiness at small scales occurs when motile phytoplankton are exposed to turbulent flow. We demonstrate experimentally that Heterosigma akashiwo forms striking patches within individual vortices and prove with a mathematical model that this patchiness results from the coupling between motility and shear. When implemented within a direct numerical simulation of turbulence, the model reveals that cell motility can prevail over turbulent dispersion to create strong fractal patchiness, where local phytoplankton concentrations are increased more than 10-fold. This 'unmixing' mechanism likely enhances ecological interactions in the plankton and offers mechanistic insights into how turbulence intensity impacts ecosystem productivity.},

We apply these four approaches to three examples of species interactions in spatially distributed populations and compare their predictions. Each represents different assumptions about the biology and hence a comparison among them has biological as well as modeling implications. In the first case all four approaches agree, in the second the spatial models disagree with the nonspatial ones, while in the third the stochastic models with discrete individuals disagree with the ones based on differential equations. We show further that the limiting reaction-diffusion equations associated with particle systems can have different qualitative behavior from those obtained by simply adding diffusion terms to mean field equations.

As in the theory of MacArthur and Wilson, our curves result from a balance between migration and extinction.

However, two other predictions that the slope increases with increasing migration/mutation and that the curves for remote islands are flatter than those for near islands, are at odds with some interpretations of data. This suggests either that the data have been misinterpreted, or that the model is not sufficient to explain them.},

Second, we examine tradeoffs between competition and dispersal distance in a two-species system. Third, we consider a cyclic competitive relationship between three types. In this case, a nonspatial treatment leads to densities that follow neutrally stable cycles or even unstable spiral solutions, while a spatial model yields a stationary distribution with an interesting spatial structure.},

Here we show that the geometric picture of community assemblage found by Nowak and May for the constant-fecundity version of this model can be extended to a whole family of tradeoffs between fecundity and mortality. In this picture, the proportion of the remaining space used by a species can be related to the amount of free space (in aspect space) behind the "competitive shadow" of the adjacent superior competitor, and in turn to the size of the competitive shadow cast by the species itself. We show that this geometric model is scale invariant in the rescaled aspect space and use this fact to investigate the limits to diversity and explore how communities assemble under this model. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

This has caused us to underestimate bacterial diversity and biased our view of bacterial communities. The tools are now available to estimate the number of bacterial species in a community and to estimate the difference between communities. Using what data are available, I have estimated that thirty grams of forest soil contains over half a million species. The species difference between related communities suggests that the number of species of bacteria may be more than a thousand million. I suppose that the explanation for such a large number of bacterial species is simply that speciation in bacteria is easy and extinction difficult, giving a rate of speciation higher than the rate of extinction, leading to an ever increasing number of species over time. The idea that speciation is easy is justified from the results of recent experimental work in bacterial evolution.},

abstract = {Hatching strategies are studied in a model of population dynamics in a random environment. The strategies are the fraction of dormant eggs that hatch each year. A projection matrix with random elements describes the population dynamics. The model extends the density- independent model of Dan Cohen and the density-dependent model of Stephen Ellner by adding structure to the egg bank, such that a fraction of the dormant eggs are buried and unavailable for hatching each year. Differences between the structured and unstructured models are analysed by deriving a small variance approximation for the population's long-term growth rate and relating the growth rate to the egg bank structure and the environmental parameters. Tuljapurkar and Istock (1993) claimed that structured and unstructured models give very different predictions, especially when dormancy is high. We show that Tuljapurkar and Istock's conclusions are the result of the particular dormancy type in their model, in which the maximum duration of dormancy is 2 years, rather than the addition of population structure. Using parameters estimated from field and experimental studies of the freshwater copepod Diaptomus sanguineus in Bullhead Pond, RI, the density-dependent model correctly predicts that the population should maintain a long-term pool of diapausing eggs, whereas the density-independent model makes the incorrect prediction that all eggs should hatch at their first opportunity. If the per capita burial and emergence rates are low, as may be the case for many plant populations, the ESS optimal hatching strategy is nearly that of an unstructured model with the mortality of non-hatchers increased by the burial rate.},

abstract = {A central goal of conservation science is to identify the most important habitat patches for maintaining biodiversity on a landscape. Spatial biodiversity patterns are often used for such assessments, and patches that harbor unique diversity are generally prioritized over those with high community similarity to other areas. This places an emphasis on biodiversity representation, but removing a patch can have cascading effects on biodiversity persistence in the remaining ecological communities. Metacommunity theory provides a mechanistic route to the linking of biodiversity patterns on a landscape with the subsequent dynamics of diversity loss after habitat is degraded. Using spatially explicit neutral theory, I focus on the situation where spatial patterns of diversity and similarity are generated by the structure of dispersal networks and not environmental gradients. I find that gains in biodiversity representation are nullified by losses in persistence, and as a result the effects of removing a patch on metacommunity diversity are essentially independent of complementarity or other biodiversity patterns. In this scenario, maximizing protected area and not biodiversity representation is the key to maintaining diversity in the long term. These results highlight the need for a broader understanding of how conservation paradigms perform under different models of metacommunity dynamics.},

Recent advances in metacommunity ecology, and neutral theory in particular, highlight the importance of dispersal processes interacting with the spatial structure of a landscape for generating spatial patterns and maintaining biodiversity. Te relative spatial isolation of a community is traditionally thought to have a large influence on local diversity. However, isolation remains an elusive concept to quantify, particularly in metacommunities with complex spatial structure. We represent the metacommunity as a network of local communities, and use network centrality measures to quantify the isolation of a local community. Using spatially explicit neutral theory, we examine how node position predicts variation in alpha diversity across a metacommunity. We find that diversity increases with node centrality in the network, but only when centrality is measured on a given scale in the network that widens with increasing dispersal rates and narrows with increasing evolutionary rates. More generally, complex biodiversity patterns form only when the underlying geography has structure on this critical scale. Tis provides a framework for understanding the influence of spatial geographic structure on global biodiversity patterns.},

Analytic theory is presented for a set of equilibrium diversity patterns in networks of communities, facilitating the exploration of parameter space not accessible by simulation. We use this theory to evaluate how the basic properties of a metacommunity - connectivity, size, and speciation rate - determine overall metacommunity gamma-diversity, and how that is partitioned into alpha- and beta-components. We find spatial structure can increase gamma-diversity relative to a well-mixed model, even when theta is held constant. The magnitude of deviations from the well-mixed model and the partitioning into alpha- and beta-diversity is related to the ratio of migration and speciation rates. gamma-diversity scales linearly with metacommunity size even as alpha- and beta-diversity scale nonlinearly with size.},

abstract = {Abstract. Local presence of plant species is determined by population colonizations and extinctions. All traits that influ- ence the capacity of individuals to colonize patches and sur- vive within patches, are therefore important for community diversity. Spatial models can explain the coexistence of spe- cies provided that the inferior competitor has a greater spatial mobility and thereby can avoid competition. We searched the literature for empirical evidence for such trade-offs and in- cluded all available information on correlations between traits associated with the capacity to colonize and traits promoting the ability to survive. A lower reproductive effort of a species is associated with a longer life span and a higher competitive ability. Morpho- logical adaptations for dispersal are less common in species which better tolerate stress, that are better competitors or possess seed dormancy. Such patterns suggest that species that are good survivors may have a limited ability to colonize new patches and vice versa. A negative correlation between dispersability and longevity has important effects on the re- gional dynamics of single species as well as on the coexistence of species. From a conservation perspective differences in the colonization capacity among species imply that restoration of plant biodiversity must not only focus on conditions within patches, but also consider the spatial arrangement of patches in order to enable plants to bridge gaps in time and space.},

abstract = {A three-species food-chain model which was previously shown to exhibit chaotic dynamics was revisited. By exploring the sensitivity of that result this study found that complex behavior depended on the functional form chosen to model the interaction between the two highest species in the food chain. Two separate scenarios were explored: the gradual addition of refugia modeling the escape from predation at low prey densities; and the gradual addition of predator interference modeling territorial behavior. The addition of even a small amount of refugia provided a stabilizing influence as the chaotic dynamics collapsed to stable limit cycles. The results of adding interference to the model were more complex. Although the numerical simulations indicated that a low level of interference provided a stabilizing influence, the analytical results suggest that complex dynamics are possible for a range of parameter values that are biologically relevant. The sensitivity of the stability profile to functional changes in the model suggests two important ecological motivations for structural stability analysis. First, in ecological systems, environmental fluctuations cause continuous changes in the functional relationships between and within species, resulting in potential changes in the complexity of the dynamics over time. Second, slight changes in ecological structure may cause significant bifurcations; however, most ecological data are inadequate to distinguish such phenomena.},

They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress.

Coexistence is promoted by intermediate levels of variability or disturbance, and by a trade-off between seed yield and seed survivorship. These results may be applicable also to other low vs. high risk life history options in unpredicta bly varying environments, such as: stress resistance vs. potentially rapid growth, high adult survivorship vs. high reproductive output.

abstract = {The ability of random fluctuations in selection to maintain genetic diversity is greatly increased when generations overlap. This result has been derived previously using genetic models with very special assumptions about the population age structure. Here we explore its robustness in more realistic population models, with very general age structure or physiological structure. For a range of genetic models (haploid, diploid, single and multi-locus) we find that the condition for maintaining genetic diversity generalizes almost without change. Genetic diversity is maintained by selection if a product of the form (generation overlap) x (selection intensity) x (variability in the selection regime) is sufficiently large, where the generation overlap is measured in units of Fisher's reproductive value. This conclusion is based on a local evolutionary stability analysis, which differs from the standard "protected polymorphism" criterion for the maintenance of genetic diversity. Simulation results match the predictions from the local stability analysis, but not those from the protected polymorphism criterion. The condition obtained here for maintaining genetic diversity requires fitness fluctuations that are substantial but well within the range observed in many studies of natural populations.},

abstract = {    * Ecologists now recognize that ecologically important traits sometimes undergo large heritable changes on the same time-scale as ecological change (‘rapid' or ‘contemporary' evolution). We know much less about the meanings of ‘sometimes' (how often?) and ‘important' (how important?). I review some of what I and my collaborators have learned about rapid evolution and suggest some of its implications.   * Rapid evolution is common: when conditions change, traits evolve. But the rate of change is hard to predict, even across a set of published laboratory predator–prey experiments, and very similar trait changes can result from very different molecular mechanisms, even within one species.   * Evolutionary rescue (adaptive response to a detrimental environmental change) is common, but not always effective. The full range is observed, from little to almost complete compensation for environmental change.   * Cases of limited compensation show that strong selection is necessary, but not sufficient for rapid adaptation. The response of the copepod Onychodiaptomus sanguineus to fluctuating predation shows that the time-scale of environmental variation is important. The response of Daphnia galeata to eutrophication shows that life-history trade-offs and constraints can prevent evolution from buffering the entire life history against environmental changes.   * Eco-evolutionary dynamics are harder to predict when traits affecting multiple interactions evolve. Theory predicted, and experiments confirmed, a much larger range of possible evolutionary outcomes when a prey species evolves defences against two predators rather than one. These and other recent findings suggest that the devil is in the details: many subtle factors, such as how trade-offs depend on resource availability, can have large effects on eco-evolutionary dynamics.   * Ecologists are increasingly engaged in predicting the ecological effects of human impacts such as species introductions and climate change. Forecasting evolutionary responses is part of that challenge. One implication of the ‘newest synthesis' is that rapid adaptation to changing conditions is nothing new, so the past and present can tell us a lot about the future.

abstract = {Rapid contemporary evolution due to natural selection is common in the wild, but it remains uncertain whether its effects are an essential component of community and ecosystem structure and function. Previously we showed how to partition change in a population, community or ecosystem property into contributions from environmental and trait change, when trait change is entirely caused by evolution (Hairston et al. 2005). However, when substantial non-heritable trait change occurs (e.g. due to phenotypic plasticity or change in population structure) that approach can mis-estimate both contributions. Here, we demonstrate how to disentangle ecological impacts of evolution vs. non-heritable trait change by combining our previous approach with the Price Equation. This yields a three-way partitioning into effects of evolution, non-heritable phenotypic change and environment. We extend the approach to cases where ecological consequences of trait change are mediated through interspecific interactions. We analyse empirical examples involving fish, birds and zooplankton, finding that the proportional contribution of rapid evolution varies widely (even among different ecological properties affected by the same trait), and that rapid evolution can be important when it acts to oppose and mitigate phenotypic effects of environmental change. Paradoxically, rapid evolution may be most important when it is least evident.},

abstract = {Chaos is usually regarded as a distinct alternative to random effects such as environmental fluctuations or external disturbances. We argue that strict separation between chaotic and stochastic dynamics in ecological systems is unnecessary and misleading, and we present a more comprehensive approach for systems subject to stochastic perturbations. The defining property of chaos is sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Chaotic systems are ''noise amplifiers'' that magnify perturbations; nonchaotic systems are ''noise mufflers'' that dampen perturbations. We also present statistical methods for detecting chaos in time-series data, based on using nonlinear time-series modeling to estimate the Lyapunov exponent lambda, which gives the average rate at which perturbation effects grow (lambda {\textgreater} 0) or decay (lambda {\textless} 0). These methods allow for dynamic noise and can detect low- dimensional chaos with realistic amounts of data. Results for natural and laboratory populations span the entire range from noise-dominated and strongly stable dynamics through weak chaos. The distribution of estimated Lyapunov exponents is concentrated near the transition between stable and chaotic dynamics. In such borderline cases the fluctuations in short- term Lyapunov exponents may be more informative than the average exponent lambda for characterizing nonlinear dynamics.},

Ecological stoichiometry provides an integrative approach for such analyses, as all organisms are composed of the same major elements (C, N, P) whose balance affects production, nutrient cycling, and food-web dynamics. Here we show both similarities and differences in the C:N:P ratios of primary producers (autotrophs) and invertebrate primary consumers (herbivores) across habitats. Terrestrial food webs are built on an extremely nutrient-poor autotroph base with C:P and C:N ratios higher than in lake particulate matter, although the N:P ratios are nearly identical. Terrestrial herbivores (insects) and their freshwater counterparts (zooplankton) are nutrient-rich and indistinguishable in C:N:P stoichiometry. In both lakes and terrestrial systems, herbivores should have low growth efficiencies (10-30{\%}) when consuming autotrophs with typical carbon-to-nutrient ratios. These stoichiometric constraints on herbivore growth appear to be qualitatively similar and widespread in both environments.},

Thus, understanding variation in biomass carbon : nitrogen : phosphorus (C : N : P) stoichiometry is a major priority for integrative biology. Among various factors affecting organism stoichiometry, differences in C : P and N : P stoichiometry have been hypothesized to reflect organismal P-content because of altered allocation to P-rich ribosomal RNA at different growth rates (the growth rate hypothesis, GRH). We tested the GRH using data for microbes, insects, and crustaceans and we show here that growth, RNA content, and biomass P content are tightly coupled across species, during ontogeny, and under physiological P limitation. We also show, however, that this coupling is relaxed when P is not limiting for growth. The close relationship between P and RNA contents indicates that ribosomes themselves represent a biogeochemically significant repository of P in ecosystems and that allocation of P to ribosome generation is a central process in biological production in ecological systems.},

Under low N deposition, phytoplankton growth is generally N-limited; however, in high–N deposition lakes, phytoplankton growth is consistently P-limited.

There are, of course, theoretical difficulties in deciding exactly what we mean by a clearly defined community or a major habitat, and also considerable practical difficulties during ecological survey work in the field in separating genuine inhabitants from accidental visitors, especially as some of the latter may play a real part in the life of the community. The following analysis is made with clear realization that all community surveys to a certain degree set arbitrary limits to the radiating connexions between species. Such partly arbitrary sections of the larger system of interspersed habitats with their communi- ties will nevertheless show something of the typical structure, without supplying a complete story.},

The difference between the squares of these two spatial scales of population fluctuations does not depend on the spatial scale of the noise but only on migration rate and strength of local density regulation. We also show how migration, local density regulation, and spatially correlated environmental noise affect the realized population process at a specific location. As the migration increases, the realized local density regulation and the expected population size increase, while the realized environmental noise decreases. This approach also enables us to analyze the dynamics of the total population size within quadrats of different sizes. The risk of local quasi extinction is strongly reduced by increasing quadrat size or migration rate, while an increase in environmental stochasticity or spatial correlation in the environmental noise increases the risk of quasi extinction.},

abstract = {A continuous stochastic population model in space and time is presented. The model includes migration and spatially correlated environmental noise, and it accounts for spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality using a general spatial autocorrelation in the local carrying capacities. The model is analyzed by Fourier methods based on linearizations which are realistic when the population fluctuations are not too large. An expression for the spatial autocorrelation for the population density is derived together with some relatively simple relations for the scaling of these autocorrelations under the assumption that the migration rate is constant. For strong local density regulation, the spatial density pattern is approximately the same as the pattern of spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality. For weak density regulation the scaling increases with migration rate and distance and is approximately the same as the scaling of the environmental noise if the migration rate and distance are large. A required distinction between the spatial autocorrelation function and the function describing the spatial variation in the synchrony of population fluctuations is made. The effects of migration distance, migration rate, heterogeneity in carrying capacities, strength of local density regulation, and the magnitude and spatial autocorrelation in the environmental noise are discussed. Numerical examples illustrating the general findings are presented.},

@article{Epstein2009,
abstract = {A theory of how microbes 'wake up' from dormancy could help to solve scientific mysteries and improve disease control, says Slava S. Epstein.  Dormancy is a useful tool. Many plants and animals survive the winter in this way; spore-forming microbes use it to survive for perhaps millions of years. But what of non-sporulating species, which make up the great majority of microbial diversity?  Since at least the 1920s, these microbes have been strongly suspected to have a dormant state. But the picture isn't clear. Dormancy is exceedingly difficult to demonstrate directly, unequivocally prove or even to study in non-spore-forming microbial species. But why is it so hard to crack?  The answer may be simple: perhaps these microorganisms have a different mechanism of revival than those we are used to. Rather than awakening to environmental cues (as plants, animals and spores do), these microbes may wake stochastically — randomly.  I envision a situation in which microbial populations consist of a mix of active and dormant cells. Faced with an adverse environmental change, more cells are induced into dormancy, and survive the challenge. Individual cells would then periodically exit dormancy as a result of infrequent and essentially random events, such as a change in the expression of a master regulatory gene. I call such awakened cells 'scouts'. If the adverse conditions persist, the scout dies. If a scout forms under growth-permissive conditions, it starts a new population. In some species, scouts might even use growth-inducing signalling compounds to wake up the rest of the dormant population. Waking the dead  Such an 'abnormal' pattern of revival, which differs from that of other microbes and contrasts with scientific expectations, would be easy to overlook. Researchers might see some evidence of revival events but, given the random nature of such events, be unable to reproduce the effect in further experiments, and so throw away legitimately positive results. Alternatively, researchers attempting to revive dormant microbes might instead find themselves accidentally and futilely attempting to wake up dead cells rather than dormant ones, thus providing a false negative.  The scout theory helps to explain apparently random disease recurrence, as happens for example with tuberculosis. Suppose that a small population of dormant cells escapes both the host's immune system and an antibiotic treatment (today's antibiotics target mainly actively growing cells). The possibility of disease recurrence would be determined by the balance between scout formation and the ability of the immune system to eliminate the scouts' progeny. When the pathogen succeeds, the relapse would seem to the observer as a random event.  If this is how microbes truly work, it has important implications. If the molecular mechanism of scout formation were known, researchers could potentially devise a way to make it less frequent, possibly to the point of rendering a population permanently dormant and thus harmless. Alternatively, they could artificially wake up all dormant cells into scouts, and dose them with drugs while they are active and vulnerable.  The scout model also redefines the nature of 'persisters', a small proportion of cells that are curiously tolerant of high concentrations of antibiotics and yet genetically identical to the vulnerable cells (by contrast with genetic mutants that might be resistant to a given antibiotic). Previous theories have proposed that microbial populations harbour specific, specialized dormant cells that survive the antibiotic challenge and grow once the challenge has been removed. It was unclear, however, how such persister cells could be both sufficiently dormant to not divide in an otherwise growing population the moment before the challenge, and then, under identical conditions after the challenge, be sufficiently active to form a colony.  My model postulates that the pool of dormant cells that survives the dose of antibiotic is substantially larger than the pool of persisters currently thought to survive. These dormant cells are effectively invisible to researchers because they do not grow, and so have been overlooked or dismissed as dead. If this pool of dormant cells continues to produce a small number of random scouts — before, during and after the antibiotic challenge — then the results are logical. Persisters are thus simply scouts generated by the large — and so far ignored — pool of true survivors. Survival scouts  Dormancy and random scout formation could also help explain the 'great plate-count anomaly': the remarkable disparity between the high number of cells in a sample, and the small number of colonies these cells form in vitro. This was first observed in the late 1800s, making it arguably the oldest unresolved microbiological mystery.  Environmental samples harbour tens of thousands of species, most of which contain just a handful of cells per population. Low abundance suggests inactivity, and dormancy. Statistically, only a small minority of such rare and dormant populations would be expected to contain scouts at any given time. The majority of populations would therefore not grow, regardless of the conditions. In principle, scouts should appear in any population given a long enough period of incubation, but in practice Petri dishes are often thrown away by that time, or are overgrown by other, fast-growing species.  This suggests several ways to recover the 'missing' microbial diversity. Single cells could be cultivated, allowing them enough time for scout production unimpeded by faster growing species. Alternatively, researchers could attempt to identify signalling compounds used by scouts, if they exist, and use these molecules to induce growth of dormant kin.  The scout model makes other predictions. For example, in a prolonged incubation, a given microbial species would be expected to produce colonies not at a specific time but continuously over the entire duration of the growth experiment. These and other predictions can be checked through very simple experiments, several of which are under way in our laboratory.  Further reading  Avery, S. V. Nature Rev. Microbiol. 4, 577–587 (2006).

abstract = {We examined and compared a variety of existing protocols for enumeration of bacteria from marine sandy sediments. The focus was on how to dislodge bacteria from sediment particles; a commercial blender, an ultrasonic cleaner, and an ultrasonic cell disrupter were tested. The ultrasonic cell disrupter was found to be the most efficient device for bacterial dislodgment. With a 5 mm microtip vibrating at 109 Fun amplitude and 20 kHz, the optimal sonication time of small (less than or equal to 0.5 cm(3)) samples was 180 s. Having identified the optimal dislodgment treatment, we went through other steps of sediment bacteria enumeration (use of surfactants, thoroughness of sample washing, bacterial staining and counterstaining, etc.), striving for additional ways of improvement. The result was a protocol that, in our study, gave bacterial counts superior to those obtained by any other protocol currently in use.},

abstract = {Graph theoretic approaches have received increased interest recently in landscape planning and conservation in the terrestrial realm, because these approaches facilitate the effective modelling of connectivity among habitats. We examined whether basic principles of graph theory can be extended to other ecosystems. Specifically, we demonstrate how a network-based context can be used for enhancing the more effective conservation of riverine systems. We first show how to use graph theoretic techniques to model riverscapes at the segment level. Then we use a real stream network (Zagyva river basin, Hungary) to examine the topological importance of segments in maintaining riverscape connectivity, using betweenness centrality, a commonly used network measure. Using the undirected graph model of this riverscape, we then prioritize segments for conservation purpose. We examine the value of each of the 93 segments present in the Zagyva river basin by considering the conservation value of local fish assemblages, connectivity and the size of the habitat patches. For this purpose we use the 'integral index of connectivity', a recently advocated habitat availability index. Based on the results the selection of the most valuable habitat segments can be optimized depending on conservation resources. Because of their inherent advantage in the consideration of connectivity relationships, we suggest that network analyses offer a simple, yet effective tool for searching for key segments (or junctions) in riverscapes for conservation and environmental management. Further, although the joint consideration of aquatic and terrestrial networks is challenging, the extension of network analyses to freshwater systems may facilitate the more effective selection of priority areas for conservation in continental areas. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Although such losses are widely viewed as an ethical and aesthetic problem, recent research reveals extensive cascading effects of their disappearance in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater ecosystems worldwide. This empirical work supports long-standing theory about the role of top-down forcing in ecosystems but also highlights the unanticipated impacts of trophic cascades on processes as diverse as the dynamics of disease, wildfire, carbon sequestration, invasive species, and biogeochemical cycles. These findings emphasize the urgent need for interdisciplinary research to forecast the effects of trophic downgrading on process, function, and resilience in global ecosystems.},

abstract = {Most mathematical models for the spread of disease use differential equations based on uniform mixing assumptions or ad hoc models for the contact process. Here we explore the use of dynamic bipartite graphs to model the physical contact patterns that result from movements of individuals between specific locations. The graphs are generated by large-scale individual-based urban traffic simulations built on actual census, land-use and population-mobility data. We find that the contact network among people is a strongly connected small-world-like graph with a well-defined scale for the degree distribution. However, the locations graph is scale-free, which allows highly efficient outbreak detection by placing sensors in the hubs of the locations network. Within this large-scale simulation framework, we then analyse the relative merits of several proposed mitigation strategies for smallpox spread. Our results suggest that outbreaks can be contained by a strategy of targeted vaccination combined with early detection without resorting to mass vaccination of a population.},

abstract = {Bet hedging is one solution to the problem of an unpredictably variable environment: fitness in the average environment is sacrificed in favor of lower variation in fitness if this leads to higher long-run stochastic mean fitness. While bet hedging is an important concept in evolutionary ecology, empirical evidence that it occurs is scant. Here we evaluate whether bet hedging occurs via seed banking in natural populations of two species of desert evening primroses (Oenothera, Onagraceae), one annual and one perennial. Four years of data on plants and 3 years of data on seeds yielded two transitions for the entire life cycle. One year was exceptionally dry, leading to reproductive failure in the sample areas, and the other was above average in precipitation, leading to reproductive success in four of five populations. Stochastic simulations of population growth revealed patterns indicative of bet hedging via seed banking, particularly in the annual populations: variance in fitness and fitness in the average environment were lower with seed banking than without, whereas long-run stochastic mean fitness was higher with seed banking than without across a wide range of probabilities of the wet year. This represents a novel, unusually rigorous demonstration of bet hedging from field data.},

abstract = {Both biogeographical and rainfall manipulation studies show that soil water content can be a strong driver of microbial community composition. However, we do not yet know if these patterns emerge because certain bacterial taxa are better able to survive at dry soil moisture regimes or if they are due to other drought-sensitive ecosystem properties indirectly affecting microbial community composition. In this study, we evaluated (1) whether bacterial community composition changed under an 11-year drought manipulation and (2) whether shifts under drought could be explained by variation in the moisture sensitivity of growth among bacterial taxa (moisture niche partitioning). Using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA, we observed shifts in bacterial community composition under drought, coincident with changes in other soil properties. We wet-up dry soils from drought plots to five moisture levels, and measured respiration and the composition of actively growing communities using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling of DNA. The field drought experiment affected the composition of the active community when incubated at different moisture levels in the laboratory, as well as short-term (36-hour) respiration rates. Independent of history, bacterial communities also displayed strong niche partitioning across the wet-up moisture gradient. Although this indicates that moisture has the potential to drive bacterial community composition under long-term drought, species distributions predicted by response to moisture did not reflect the community composition of plots that were subjected to long-term drought. Bacterial community structure was likely more strongly driven by other environmental factors that changed under long-term drought, or not shaped by response to water level upon wet-up. The approach that we present here for linking niches to community composition could be adapted for other environmental variables to aid in predicting microbial species distributions and community responses to environmental change.},

abstract = {We used a combination of field studies and laboratory experiments to char- acterize key ecological aspects of the seed biology and soil seed bank dynamics of annual plant communities in chenopod shrublands of South Australia. A sequential study of the soil seed bank demonstrated seasonal and between-year variability in numbers and com- position of the soil seed bank. Soil samples incubated under different temperature and watering regimes produced different communities, indicating that species respond differ- entially to various environmental combinations. Emergence was extremely low at low water availability and at high temperatures, even in trays with ample water. A high percentage of seeds of four out of five species buried in the field remained viable for two years, while the fifth, Carrichtera annua, showed a sharp decline in seed viability, reaching nearly zero survivorship. Our results indicate that, in this system, annual plant communities result from germination of a fraction of seeds present in the soil seed bank, when autumn or winter rainfalls occur. Because different species have different responses to various combinations of environmental conditions, the community composition varies from year to year. This variability is likely to be a component of coexistence through the storage effect.},

In particular, the hierarchical, dendritic structures of riverine networks are not well captured by existing spatial models. Here I use a simple. geometric model and metapopulation modeling to make three points concerning the ecological consequences of dendritic landscapes. First, connectivity patterns of-river-creek networks differ from linear landscapes, and these differences in connectivity can either enhance or reduce metapopulation persistence compared to linear systems, depending on the details of dispersal. Second, habitat fragmentation in dendritic landscapes has different (and arguably, more severe) consequences on fragment size than in either linear or two-dimensional systems, resulting in both smaller fragments and higher variance in fragment size. Third, dendritic landscapes can induce striking mismatches between the geometry of dispersal and the geometry of disturbance, and as is the case for arid-lands fishes, such mismatches can be important for population persistence},

abstract = {The literature on effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity is huge. It is also very diverse, with different authors measuring fragmentation in dif- ferent ways and, as a consequence, drawing different conclusions regarding both the magnitude and direction of its effects. Habitat fragmentation is usually defined as a landscape-scale process involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habi- tat. Results of empirical studies of habitat fragmentation are often difficult to inter- pret because (a) many researchers measure fragmentation at the patch scale, not the landscape scale and (b) most researchers measure fragmentation in ways that do not distinguish between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat after controlling for habitat loss. Empirical studies to date suggest that habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity. Habitat frag- mentation per se has much weaker effects on biodiversity that are at least as likely to be positive as negative. Therefore, to correctly interpret the influence of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, the effects of these two components of fragmentation must be measured independently. More studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation per se are needed to determine the factors that lead to positive versus negative effects of fragmentation per se. I suggest that the term "fragmen- tation" should be reserved for the breaking apart of habitat, independent of habitat loss. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {Nutrient-diffusing substrates for periphyton were made from clay flower pots, sealed with plastic petri dishes, and filled with 2{\%} agar and specified nutrients. When placed in water, the nutrients slowly diffuse through the agar and clay walls of the pots, becoming available to organisms colonizing the outer surface. Forty-eight pots, 16 containing 0.1 M KH2PO4, 16 with 0.1 M NaNO3, and 16 with no added nutrients, were placed at 0.5 m depth in Douglas Lake, Michigan [USA]. Four pots of each nutrient treatment were sampled for algal periphyton and invertebrates after 7, 14, 25 and 36 days. A total of 72 algal species were enumerated. Of these, Epithemia adnata (Kuetz.) Breb., Rhopalodia gibba (Ehr.) O. Muell and Anabaena sp. experienced strong growth stimulation in response to phosphate addition. No significant effects of nitrate addition were noted. Measures of algal community structure also reflected the impact of phosphate addition. Final algal biomass was enhanced 10-fold, successional change was prolonged, and species diversity declined relative to nitrate and control pots. Chironomids, chydorid Cladocera, and gastropods dominated the invertebrate fauna found on the pots. Densities of the small, algivorous chironomid Corynoneura nr. lobata Edwards were highest on phosphate pots at the end of the study, in apparent response to the increase in periphyton biomass.},

abstract = {Virtually all nonequilibrium electron transfers on Earth are driven by a set of nanobiological machines composed largely of multimeric protein complexes associated with a small number of prosthetic groups. These machines evolved exclusively in microbes early in our planet's history yet, despite their antiquity, are highly conserved. Hence, although there is enormous genetic diversity in nature, there remains a relatively stable set of core genes coding for the major redox reactions essential for life and biogeochemical cycles. These genes created and coevolved with biogeochemical cycles and were passed from microbe to microbe primarily by horizontal gene transfer. A major challenge in the coming decades is to understand how these machines evolved, how they work, and the processes that control their activity on both molecular and planetary scales.},

abstract = {A species-addition experiment showed that prairie grasslands have a structured, nonneutral assembly process in which resident species inhibit, via resource consumption, the establishment and growth of species with similar resource use patterns and in which the success of invaders decreases as diversity increases. In our experiment, species in each of four functional guilds were introduced, as seed, into 147 prairie-grassland plots that previously had been established and maintained to have different compositions and diversities. Established species most strongly inhibited introduced species from their own functional guild. Introduced species attained lower abundances when functionally similar species were abundant and when established species left lower levels of resources unconsumed, which occurred at higher [corrected] species richness. Residents of the C4 grass functional guild, the dominant guild in nearby native grasslands, reduced the major limiting resource, soil nitrate, to the lowest levels in midsummer and exhibited the greatest inhibitory effect on introduced species. This simple mechanism of greater competitive inhibition of invaders that are similar to established abundant species could, in theory, explain many of the patterns observed in plant communities.},

abstract = {This study used 20-year records of stream channel change and wood to test hypotheses about the long-term influence of large woody debris (LWD) on channel morphology, channel stability, and sediment dynamics in a steep, boulder-rich mountain stream. We compared two nearly adjacent reaches of third-order Mack Creek over the period 1978-1997 after virtually all wood was removed from the channel of the lower reach in 1964. We assessed the long-term legacy of wood removal using repeated cross-section surveys, streamflow data, LWD inventory data, and detailed mapping and longitudinal profile surveys. At each of 11 cross sections in the upper reach and 19 in the lower reach, we calculated areas of scour and fill in response to the two largest floods in the record. We used quasi-likelihood logistic regression models to test the proportion of each reach that experienced change between consecutive surveys over the entire record (1978-1997) as a function of flood return periods. The longitudinal profile of the site without LWD was more variable than the reach with LWD at the finest scale (∼1 m) due to a greater frequency of boulder steps, but the reach with LWD was more variable at the channel unit scale. LWD-created steps 1 to 2.5 m high in the wood-rich reach accounted for nearly 30{\%} of the total channel fall and created low-gradient upstream channel segments one to three channel widths long. As a result, both reaches have the same average slope (about 9{\%}), but nearly three times as much of the channel in the wood-rich reach had a slope of ≤5{\%} as in the reach without wood (20.4{\%} of total channel length vs. 7.5{\%} of channel length). The reach with abundant LWD was less responsive to moderate streamflow events (return period ∼5 years), but it responded similarly to peak flows with a return period of about 10 to 25 years. Although the average magnitude of cross-section changes was the same during the largest flood in the record (25-year return period), the reach without LWD experienced scour and coarsening of the bed surface, whereas the reach with LWD experienced aggradation upstream of LWD features. Mack Creek may be representative of many steep mountain streams in which channel structure is strongly influenced by nonfluvial processes: a legacy of large boulders from glacial or mass movement processes and a legacy of dead wood from ecological processes. Sediment-limited mountain streams with large boulders, when deprived of LWD, appear to exhibit less morphological variation at the channel unit scale, to store less sediment, and to release it more readily than those with LWD. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {We studied the diversity, community composition and activity of the primary microbial colonizers of the water above freshly re-wetted sediments from a temporary river. Dried sediments, collected from Mulargia River (Sardinia, Italy), were covered with sterile freshwater in triplicate microcosms, and changes of the planktonic microbial assemblage were monitored over a 48 h period. During the first 9 h bacterial abundance was low (1.5 x 10(4) cells ml(-1)); it increased to 3.4 x 10(6) cells ml(-1) after 28 h and did not change thereafter. Approximately 20{\%} of bacteria exhibited DNA de novo synthesis already after 9 h of incubation. Changes of the ratios of (3)H-leucine to (3)H-thymidine incorporation rates indicated a shift of growth patterns during the experiment. Extracellular enzyme activity showed a maximum at 48 h with aminopeptidase activity (430.8 +/- 22.6 nmol MCA l(-1) h(-1)) significantly higher than alkaline phosphatase (98.6 +/- 4.3 nmol MUF l(-1) h(-1)). The primary microbial colonizers of the overlaying water - as determined by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis - were related to at least six different phylogenetic lineages of Bacilli and to Alphaproteobacteria (Brevundimonas spp. and Caulobacter spp.). Large bacterial cells affiliated to one clade of Bacillus sp. were rare in the dried sediments, but constituted the majority of the planktonic microbial assemblage and of cells with detectable DNA-synthesis until 28 h after re-wetting. Their community contribution decreased in parallel with a rise of flagellated and ciliated protists. Estimates based on cell production rates suggested that the rapidly enriched Bacillus sp. suffered disproportionally high loss rates from selective predation, thus favouring the establishment of a more heterogenic assemblage of microbes (consisting of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Cytophaga-Flavobacteria). Our results suggest that the primary microbial colonizers of the water above dried sediments are passively released into the plankton and that their high growth potential is counteracted by the activity of bacterivorous protists.},

abstract = {The dynamics of in situ bacterial communities in the hyporheic zone of an intermittent stream were described in high spatiotemporal detail. We assessed community dynamics in stream sediments and interstitial pore water over a two-year period using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Here, we show that sediments remained saturated despite months of drought and limited hydrologic connectivity. The intermittency of stream surface water affected interstitial pore water communities more than hyporheic sediment communities. Seasonal changes in bacterial community composition was significantly associated with water intermittency, phosphate concentrations, temperature, nitrate and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. During periods of low- to no-surface water, communities changed from being rich in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in isolated surface pools, to a few OTUs overall, including an overall decline in both common and rare taxa. Individual OTUs were compared between porewater and sediments. A total of 19{\%} of identified OTUs existed in both porewater and sediment samples, suggesting that bacteria use hyporheic sediments as a type of refuge from dessication, transported through hydrologically connected pore spaces. Stream intermittency impacted bacterial diversity on rapid timescales (that is, within days), below-ground and in the hyporheic zone. Owing to the coupling of intermittent streams to the surrounding watershed, we stress the importance of understanding connectivity at the pore scale, consequences for below-ground and above-ground biodiversity and nutrient processing, and across both short- and long-time periods (that is, days to months to years).},

abstract = {The theory of ecological stoichiometry holds that heterotrophs are mostly homeostatic and exhibit less variation in body stoichiometry than do autotrophs. Most studies of stream foodweb stoichiometry have been done in low-nutrient environments. Little is known about foodweb stoichiometry in nutrient-rich streams, in which a higher level of stoichiometric homeostasis should be expected, mainly because imbalances between resources and consumers are low and nutrient availability may meet biotic requirements. We analyzed elemen- tal content (C, N, P) and stoichiometric ratios (C∶N, C∶P, N∶P) of basal resources, macroinvertebrates, and fishes in a nutrient-rich Pampean stream and compared these values to those from other studies. We manipulated P and N in a 1-y fertilization experiment to analyze biotic stoichiometric responses to additional nutrient input to this naturally enriched system. Soluble reactive P concentration in the treatment reach was doubled relative to the background concentration. Consumers had lower C∶Pand N∶P than those in other lotic systems, whereas P con- tent and C∶Pand N∶P of basal resources were within the ranges observed for other systems. Most components of the trophic web were not affected by fertilization, and only epiphyton, fine benthic organic matter, and 2 macro- invertebrate species (Palaemonetes argentinus and Pomacea canaliculata) changed their nutrient content or stoichio- metric ratios. Imbalances in C∶Nand C∶P occurred between primary consumers and their resources, particularly among macroinvertebrate collectors and detritivorous fishes feeding on FBOM. Most basal resources and consum- ers were strictly homeostatic for P content and the stoichiometric ratios, but a lower degree of homeostasis occurred in the epiphyton, P. canaliculata, and collectors feeding on epiphyton. A high degree of stoichiometric homeosta- sis existsacrossthe various componentsofthe food webinthisnutrient-rich stream,regardless oftheir trophic position.},

abstract = {We used whole-stream and benthic chamber methods to measure rates of metabolism and determine the contribution of the hyporheic zone to ecosystem respiration (R) in two streams with differing surface-subsurface exchange characteristics, Rio Calaveras and Gallina Creek, New Mexico. We used the difference between whole-stream and benthic R to calculate the rate of hyporheic zone R and coupled this estimate to an independent measure of hyporheic sediment R to estimate the cross-sectional area of the hyporheic zone (AH) for two reaches from each stream. Conservative tracer injections and solute transport modeling were used to characterize surface-subsurface hydrologic exchange by determining values of the cross-sectional area of the transient storage zone (As). The hyporheic zone contributed a substantial proportion of whole-stream R in all four study reaches, ranging from 40 to 93{\%}. Whole-stream R, hyporheic R, and percent contribution of hyporheic R all increased as transient storage increased, with whole-stream and hyporheic R exhibiting significant relationships with As. All three measures of respiration and values of AH were much greater for both reaches of the stream with greater surface-subsurface exchange. AH is valuable for cross-site comparisons because it accounts for differences in rates of both benthic and hyporheic sediment R and can be used to predict the importance of the hyporheic zone to other stream ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {A model of speciation has been constructed involving two loci under natural selection in two subpopulations, with different alleles adapted to the different subpopulations. Progress toward speciation in this model consists of association of a third locus, at which there is assortative mating, with the original two loci. Cases can be found in which speciation cannot occur. The evolutionary force acting against speciation turns out to be recombination, which acts to randomize the association between the prezygotic isolating mechanism (assortative mating) and the adaptations to the two environments. This model suggests that there is an important distinction between two kinds of speciation. One involves speciation by substitution of the same alleles in the two nascent species, the other by substitution of different alleles. Only in the latter case does recombination act as a force retarding or blocking speciation.},

Recent approaches using household landscaping have begun to tackle these obstacles; others, including adaptive management, restoration, recla- mation, and wetland construction, reveal overlaps between ecological experiments and urban design. “Designed experiments” propose going beyond current strategies to partner with urban designers, landscape architects, and architects to insert architecturally designed experiments into the urban mosaic. The inter- disciplinary approach of designed experiments exploits the aesthetics and functions of urban design, balancing ecological goals with important design factors such as context, public amenities, and safety. Designed experiments represent a novel way for ecologists to help improve urban environments by providing a means with which to work with urban designers in creating attractive, practical, and replicated ex- perimental designs that generate quality ecological data from metropolitan sites.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION While the existence of protozoa and minute metazoa has been known for a long time, it was during the 1930s that the concepts of microbenthos and benthic microfaunal communities were first recognized. Recognition was due particularly to the work of the Kiel school of marine biology in Germany (109, 115). What stimulated zoologists to study this fauna was the discovery of new and morphologically aberrant forms between the sandgrains of littoral and sublittoral sediments, such as the medusa Halamohydra, less than 1 mm in diameter, and a solitary bryozoan, Monobryozoon. Previously unknown or very poorly known taxonomic groups (e.g. macrodasyoid gastrotrichs, gnathostomulids, and mystacocarids) were discovered.- Easily accessible habitats (such as beach sand) in otherwise faunistically well-known parts of the world yielded a wealth of new species, of which many represented new types of animal organization (e.g. 5, 6, 103, 108, 110, 118). This exploratory phase naturally gave rise to a number of faunistic and taxonomic monographs. Morphological adaptations of the newly discovered fauna quickly drew attention. In particular, it was shown how convergent evolution in unrelated taxonomic groups had led to a number of morphological and behavioral features that could be interpreted as adaptations to the movement of life in the interstices of sand grains. Also the relation between small size and organization was studied, namely, how organisms belonging to groups characterized by a complex organization (holothurians, ascidians, polychaetes, and molluscs) are built when they measure only between 0.5 and 5 mm (6, 113, 128). Early attempts were also made to classify microfaunal communities (biocoenoses) and to correlate these with environmental factors, in particular with salinity and the mechanical properties of the sediment (39, 101, 102, 109). Of special interest was the discovery of microfaunas characteristic of coastal and of terrestrial ground water (21, 115). Krogh {\&} Sparck (81) and Mare (90) were the first to consider the quantitative role of the benthic microfauna. Since then, the quantification of microbenthos and},

abstract = {Adaptive dynamics theory has been devised to account for feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes. Doing so opens new dimensions to and raises new challenges about evolutionary rescue. Adaptive dynamics theory predicts that successive trait substitutions driven by eco-evolutionary feedbacks can gradually erode population size or growth rate, thus potentially raising the extinction risk. Even a single trait substitution can suffice to degrade population viability drastically at once and cause 'evolutionary suicide'. In a changing environment, a population may track a viable evolutionary attractor that leads to evolutionary suicide, a phenomenon called 'evolutionary trapping'. Evolutionary trapping and suicide are commonly observed in adaptive dynamics models in which the smooth variation of traits causes catastrophic changes in ecological state. In the face of trapping and suicide, evolutionary rescue requires that the population overcome evolutionary threats generated by the adaptive process itself. Evolutionary repellors play an important role in determining how variation in environmental conditions correlates with the occurrence of evolutionary trapping and suicide, and what evolutionary pathways rescue may follow. In contrast with standard predictions of evolutionary rescue theory, low genetic variation may attenuate the threat of evolutionary suicide and small population sizes may facilitate escape from evolutionary traps.},

abstract = {Conflicting views on the potential importance of soil water as a source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in headwater streams are addressed by comparing organic chemistries of soil waters in the riparian zone with an adjacent stream at an upland site in mid-Wales during one year. DOC, which as a whole is relatively refractory, was contrasted with the labile dissolved free amino acids (DFAAs). DOC distributions in riparian soil waters showed little temporal or spatial consistency, but concentrations almost always exceeded those in the stream (mean = 9.4 and 2.1 mg l−1, respectively). This represents an average carbon input of some 2500 g C m−2 year−1 to the stream, indicating the quantitative importance of DOC in riparian soil waters to stream productivity. Total DFAA concentrations were {\textless}0.3{\%} of the DOC measured. Although their mean concentrations were also higher in soil waters (168.2 nmol l−1) than in the stream (113.9 nmol l−1), this was not a consistent trend. Most probably the DFAAs' lability resulted in their almost complete immobilization within the streambed during microporous discharge of catchment runoff through the streambed. Three major hydrological flow paths in the riparian zone were inferred by correlating dynamics of the organic chemistry, as well as inorganic nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate), between sampling points. A lack of any dynamic relationship between organic concentrations in saturated through-flow of the stream bank and the stream suggested an efficient immobilization of this soil water DOC within the streambed, prior to its discharge into the stream; an immobilization particularly significant at baseflow. Correlations for both DOC and inorganic N between the stream bank unsaturated zone and the stream suggested that, at least at higher flows, this soil water input could directly influence the stream. A high degree of correlation between soil waters of the forest edge (6m from the stream) and the stream suggested that some form of macroporous transfer of soil water from further back in the riparian zone could also directly influence the stream. These results reveal the complexity of the riparian environment. It is concluded that the riparian zone can contribute substantial amounts of DOC to a stream ecosystem, and that the streambed must be a key area of chemical reactivity where much of this material is initially processed. As the delivery of DOC to the streambed will depend on the hydrology of the riparian zone, a knowledge of this is an essential prerequisite to modelling the transfer of organic material from a catchment to a stream.},

Until recently, similar studies were impossible for microorganisms, arguably the most diverse and abundant group of organisms on Earth. Here, we present a continental-scale description of soil bacterial communities and the environmental factors influencing their biodiversity. We collected 98 soil samples from across North and South America and used a ribosomal DNA-fingerprinting method to compare bacterial community composition and diversity quantitatively across sites. Bacterial diversity was unrelated to site temperature, latitude, and other variables that typically predict plant and animal diversity, and community composition was largely independent of geographic distance. The diversity and richness of soil bacterial communities differed by ecosystem type, and these differences could largely be explained by soil pH (r(2) = 0.70 and r(2) = 0.58, respectively; P {\textless} 0.0001 in both cases). Bacterial diversity was highest in neutral soils and lower in acidic soils, with soils from the Peruvian Amazon the most acidic and least diverse in our study.

We reconstructed the soil microbial diversity that once existed in this biome by analyzing relict prairie soils and found that the biogeographical patterns were largely driven by changes in the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia, a poorly studied bacterial phylum that appears to dominate many prairie soils. Shotgun metagenomic data suggested that these spatial patterns were associated with strong shifts in carbon dynamics. We show that metagenomic approaches can be used to reconstruct below-ground biogeochemical and diversity gradients in endangered ecosystems; such information could be used to improve restoration efforts, given that even small changes in below-ground microbial diversity can have important impacts on ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {We determined the biogeographical distributions of stream bacteria and the biogeochemical factors that best explained heterogeneity for 23 locations within the Hubbard Brook watershed, a 3000-ha forested watershed in New Hampshire, USA. Our goal was to assess the factor, or set of factors, responsible for generating the biogeographical patterns exhibited by microorganisms at the landscape scale. We used DNA fingerprinting to characterize bacteria inhabiting fine benthic organic matter (FBOM) because of their important influence on stream nutrient dynamics. Across the watershed, streams of similar pH had similar FBOM bacterial communities. Streamwater pH was the single variable most strongly correlated with the relative distance between communities (Spearman's p = 0.66, P {\textless} 0.001) although there were other contributing factors, including the quality of the fine benthic organic matter and the amount of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen in the stream water (P {\textless} 0.05 for each). There was no evidence of an effect of geographic distance on bacterial community composition, suggesting that dispersal limitation has little influence on the observed biogeographical patterns in streams across this landscape. Cloning and sequencing of small-subunit rRNA genes confirmed the DNA fingerprinting results and revealed strong shifts among bacterial groups along the pH gradient. With an increase in streamwater pH, the abundance of acidobacteria in the FBOM bacterial community decreased (from 71{\%} to 38{\%}), and the abundance of proteobacteria increased (from 11{\%} to 47{\%}). Together these results suggest that microorganisms, like "macro"-organisms, do exhibit biogeographical patterns at the landscape scale and that these patterns may be predictable based on biogeochemical factors.},

Although most aquatic organisms lack the capacity to disperse by themselves to neighbouring catchments, many species present widespread distributions consistent with frequent dispersal by migratory waterbirds. 2. A literature review indicates that bird-mediated passive transport of propagules of aquatic invertebrates and plants is a frequent process in the field, at least at a local scale. Both endozoochory (internal transport) and ectozoochory (external transport) are important processes. 3. The characteristics of the dispersed and the disperser species that facilitate such transport remain largely uninvestigated, but a small propagule size tends to favour dispersal by both internal and external transport. 4. We review the information currently available on the processes of waterbird-mediated dispersal, establishing the limits of current knowledge and highlighting problems with research methods used in previous studies. We also identify studies required in the future to further our understanding of the role of such dispersal in aquatic ecology},

It is determined by genetics with a substantial environmental influence which is mediated, at least in part, by the plant hormones abscisic acid and gibberellins. Not only is the dormancy status influenced by the seed maturation environment, it is also continuously changing with time following shedding in a manner determined by the ambient environment. As dormancy is present throughout the higher plants in all major climatic regions, adaptation has resulted in divergent responses to the environment. Through this adaptation, germination is timed to avoid unfavourable weather for subsequent plant establishment and reproductive growth. In this review, we present an integrated view of the evolution, molecular genetics, physiology, biochemistry, ecology and modelling of seed dormancy mechanisms and their control of germination. We argue that adaptation has taken place on a theme rather than via fundamentally different paths and identify similarities underlying the extensive diversity in the dormancy response to the environment that controls germination.},

abstract = {In many streams, significant amounts of water are exchanged between saturated sediments surrounding the open channel (the hyporheic zone) and the channel itself. Such exchanges with the hyproheic zone have the potential to cause large changes in streamwater chemistry because the rates of biogeochemical processes and the actual types of processes (e.g. anaerobic vs. aerobic metabolism) may be fundamentally different. I propose an organizational scheme for grouping stream systems into clusters of minimal, moderate, and maximal contribution of hyporheic metabolism to the overall ecosystem. Lack of information on quantitative hydrology for different stream systems prohibits actual testing of this framework. An alternative scheme is presented that organizes several well-studied streams as a function of subsurface residence time and differences in oxygen content. This second scheme is intended to stimulate discussion of conceptual frameworks for cross-system comparisons of the importance of hyporheic sediments in stream ecosystems. -Vadose Zone},

abstract = {Hyporheic sediment bacterial communities were exposed to dissolved organic matter (DOM) from a variety of sources to assess the interdependence of bacterial metabolism and community composition. Experiments ranged from small-scale core perfusions with defined compounds (glucose, bovine serum albumin) to mesocosms receiving natural leaf leachate or water from different streams. Response variables included bacterial production, oxygen consumption, extracellular enzyme activity, and community similarity as manifest by changes in banding patterns of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). All DOM manipulations generated responses in at least one metabolic variable. Additions of both labile and recalcitrant materials increased either oxygen consumption, production, or both depending on background DOM. Enzyme activities were affected by both types of carbon addition with largest effects from the labile mixture. Cluster analysis of RAPD data showed strong divergence of communities exposed to labile versus recalcitrant DOM. Additions of leaf leachate to mesocosms representing hyporheic flowpaths caused increases in oxygen consumption and some enzyme activities with weaker effects on production. Community structure was strongly affected; samples from the leachate-amended mesocosms clustered separately from the control samples. In mesocosms receiving water from streams ranging in DOC (0.5-4.5 mg L-1), there were significant differences in bacterial growth, oxygen consumption, and enzyme activities. RAPD analysis showed strongest clustering of samples by stream type with more subtle effects of position along the flowpaths. Responses in community metabolism were always accompanied by shifts in community composition, suggesting carbon supply affects both functional and structural attributes of hyporheic bacterial communities.},

The reference stream (Bear Brook) has a closed canopy Low epilithic primary production, and a high standing stock of detrital organic matter. A nearby stream in a clear-cut catchment had experienced algal blooms in the early years following cutting, and rates of primary production measured during our study period were 5 times greater than in Bear Brook. Chlorophyll a concentrations on tiles did not differ between streams, indicating that algal abundance was limited by factors other than light availability. Bacteria were not consistently correlated with algal abundances in either stream. Bacterial abundance and growth did not differ statistically between streams despite the large differences in rates of primary production. A shading experiment conducted in both streams was successful in reducing chlorophyll levels but did not reduce bacterial growth rates. A laboratory experiment involving nutrient additions and high light levels greatly stimulated algal abundance and carbon fixation, but there was no parallel increase in bacterial abundance or growth. Apparently, in contrast to planktonic systems, there is not a tight trophic connection between algal and bacterial productivity in these streams.},

abstract = {A set of near-stream flowpaths in pasture, native forest and exotic pine plantations in New Zealand was sampled to describe differences in dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The quantity and bioavailability of DOC varied among flowpaths in different land uses, with higher concentrations of DOC in near-stream flow paths than the parent groundwater emerging from the hillslope. Tiles incubated in these waters did not consistently yield higher bacterial growth rates than tiles incubated in groundwaters. DOC composition, measured as fluorescence and absorbance properties and extracellular enzyme fingerprints, differed significantly among land uses and position along flowpath. Differences in riparian vegetation can indirectly affect DOC by altering exposure to ultraviolet radiation. A 2-h exposure of water from subsurface flowpaths to full sunlight caused marked changes in fluorescence characteristics of water from the pasture catchment but only small changes in water from the native forest catchment. There were up to fivefold differences in extracellular enzyme activities on tiles incubated in light-exposed water for the native forest site, but not for the pasture site. Bacterial growth and respiration were higher on tiles incubated in native forest water exposed to sunlight, but there was no light effect on growth for tiles incubated in water from the pasture flowpath. These results indicate that riparian flowpaths will affect the quantity and character of DOC delivered to streams and ultraviolet exposure may, at least in some cases, alter DOC bioavailability.},

abstract = {Biofilms growing on gravel surfaces representative of hyporheic sediments were exposed to inorganic nitrogen or amino acid additions in experimental systems to examine potential responses in bacterial growth, oxygen removal, extracellular enzyme activities and bacterial community structure. Additions of ammonium and a mixture of amino acids increased oxygen removal by {\textgreater}50 {\%} in small perfusion cores, with a stronger response to amino acids than equimolar NH4 addition. Some extracellular enzyme activities were affected by a significant increase in alpha- and beta-glucosidase activities in amino acid relative to NH4 additions, while peptidase activities were only weakly affected by either NH4 or amino acid addition. Community structure assayed via RAPDs did not change in parallel with responses of metabolic variables, and there was no concordance between RAPD clusters and experimental treatment. In flow-through mesocosms mimicking hyporheic flowpaths, similar additions of NH4 and amino acids yielded significant differences in patterns of oxygen decline along the flowpaths. Differences in bacterial growth and extracellular enzyme activity were restricted to the sampling locations closest to the head of the flowpath (point of N injection) with a general convergence of values nearer the end of mesocosms. As for the perfusion core experiment, there was no concordance between metabolic and community structural response as measured by clustering of RAPD data. Nitrogen supply clearly altered biofilm. metabolic activity but there was no parallel change in community structure. We suggest that the ability to acquire inorganic nitrogen or amino acid nitrogen is sufficiently distributed across bacterial taxa so that shifts in function do not necessarily require shifts in bacterial community structure.},

abstract = {Planktonic bacterial production in the tidal freshwater Hudson River is a major component of secondary productivity and is uncoupled from planktonic primary productivity. There are several major sources of allochthonous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) whose potential contribution to heterotrophic bacterial growth was examined with bioassays. Supply of DOC from the upper Hudson drainage basin and a large tributary in the mid-Hudson together comprise 70 kT DOC/year, which is the bulk of the DOC load to the tidal freshwater Hudson River. Two contrasting tidal wetlands contribute DOC to the main-stem river but were only a few percent of the tributary load even during summer low-flow conditions. The quantity of DOC released from fine sediments was intermediate to the other two loadings considered. Bacterial growth in bioassays receiving water from the sources varied, but differences in thymidine incorporation between reference and DOC sources were small, usually less than 2 nmol/L/h. Similarity in thymidine incorporation suggests that all sources of DOC were capable of supporting bacterial growth at approximately equal rates. Seasonal shifts in carbon availability were clear in several cases, for example, greater growth on wetland-derived DOC at times of peak plant productivity. Seasonal differences in tributary DOC bioavailability were not large despite the well-known seasonality of tributary inputs. Activities of a suite of extracellular enzymes were used as a biologically based characterization of DOC from the various sources. Shifts in allocation among enzymes were apparent, indicating Chat there are biologically relevant differences in composition among the sources. Fluorescence characteristics and absorbance per unit carbon also varied among sources, providing an independent confirmation of compositional differences among sources. The absence of large differences in bacterial productivity among sources suggests that growth is supported by a wide range of DOG, and the relative importance of the sources is probably related to the quantitative differences in inputs. Efforts to classify carbon supplies to ecosystems must recognize that organism plasticity in carbon use and physical mixing processes will both act to homogenize what might initially appear to be quite distinctive carbon inputs.},

The rate of DOC removal was estimated from the decline in DOC and travel time through the bar. Variability in DOC removal together with potential regulatory factors was determined for 14 dates spanning more than a 2-y period. DOC removal was not correlated with temperature, availability of oxygen, or residence time within hyporheic sediments. Hyporheic DOC could be predicted (r(2) = 0.68) from streamwater DOC concentrations, with a surprisingly constant 57{\%} (+/-9{\%} [1 SD]) removal of DOC. This pattern suggests an initial concentration-dependent adsorption of DOC onto surfaces. This mechanism allows for efficient retention of DOC within hyporheic sediments even under conditions (low temperature, high interstitial velocity) that might be expected to minimize biotic consumption of DOC.},

abstract = {Headwaters (stream orders 1–2) traditionally have been considered depauperate compared to mid-order streams (orders 3–4)—a conclusion that arises from a perception of streams as linear systems and emphasizes change in average $\alpha$ (local) diversity along streams. We hypothesized an opposite pattern for $\beta$ (among-site) diversity and suggest that headwaters might account for a large degree of basin-scale biodiversity if considered within the more realistic framework of streams as branching networks. We assembled pre-existing biodiversity data from across the globe to test this hypothesis broadly at the population-genetic (mitochondrial haplotype diversity within species) and community (species/taxonomic diversity) levels, with a focus on macroinvertebrates. We standardized 18 (9 headwater and 9 mid-order) population-genetic and 16 (10 headwater and 6 mid-order) community-level ecoregional data sets from 5 global ecozones for robust comparisons of $\beta$-diversity estimates between the 2 stream-size categories. At the population-genetic level, we applied measures of among-site variation commonly used at both population-genetic (FST and $\Phi$ST) and community (S{\o}rensen's dissimilarity with both presence/absence and abundance data) levels and developed a novel strategy to compare expected rates of loss of $\gamma$ (regional) diversity as individual sites are eliminated sequentially from regions. At the community level, we limited analyses to S{\o}rensen's presence/absence measures. We found that S{\o}rensen's dissimilarity was significantly greater among headwaters than among mid-order streams at both population-genetic and community levels. We also showed that individual headwater reaches accounted for greater proportions of genetic $\gamma$ diversity than did mid-order reaches. However, neither FST nor $\Phi$ST was significantly different between stream-size categories. These measures, which have been used traditionally for comparisons of population-genetic variation, measure proportions of total variation rather than solely among-site variation (i.e., they also are influenced by within-site variation). In contrast, S{\o}rensen's dissimilarity measures only among-site variation and, therefore, is presumably more useful for reflecting general $\beta$ diversity. Overall results suggest that, on average, headwaters probably contribute disproportionately to biodiversity at the network scale. This finding demands a shift in thinking about the biodiversity contributions of small headwaters and has strong conservation implications for imperiled headwater streams around the world.},

abstract = {Given the unique spatial structure of stream habitat and the stochasticity characteristic of lotic ecosystems, metacommunity approaches hold much promise in the field of stream ecology. We take advantage of the tight parallels between neutral theories of molecular evolution and community assembly and present a novel conceptual approach to evaluating the role of stochasticity and dispersal limitation in structuring stream metacommunities. The analogous neutral frameworks generate similar expectations for the spatial structure of species comprising communities and genes comprising populations, particularly among patchily distributed, isolated local habitats (e.g., headwater streams) where among-stream dispersal is expected to be limited. Our emphasis is on the conceptual value of this approach, but we also used a limited data set composed of intensively sampled community and population-genetic data collected from 5 to 7 Rocky Mountain alpine streams for illustrative purposes. We characterized neutral population genetic structure as mitochondrial haplotype distributions for the blackfly Prosimulium neomacropyga, which shows strong genetic isolation by distance across the study region. We assessed community structure as the relative frequencies of ecologically similar species in the family Chironomidae collected annually over 2000–2003. Species richness was positively correlated with haplotype richness across streams (r = 0.55), and analogous methods revealed significant b diversity at both the population-genetic (FST = 0.23) and the community (FST = 0.16) levels. However, a more spatially explicit comparison of pairwise community dissimilarity and genetic distance revealed no evidence of correlation (Mantel test, r=20.18, p=0.54), a result suggesting no effect of spatial distance on community similarity at the relatively fine spatial scale of our study. We discuss 2 key arguments to explain the lack of community distance decay: 1) unaccounted environmental differences among streams, and 2) varying spatial and temporal scales of neutral processes (including genetic drift and ecological drift; i.e., stochastic temporal change) between population-genetic andcommunity levels. Evidence for both selective and neutral explanations is compelling in this system. The explanations cannot be disentangled with the current data, but the study has strong heuristic value that we hope will stimulate future efforts in stream metacommunity analysis.},

Characteristic biogeochemical processes in these subsystems alter nitrogen (N) species in transport, in part as a function of available concentrations of N species. At several hierarchical levels, substrate materials are an important determinant of nitrogen dynamics in desert streams. Sand is present in bars of variable size and shape, each of which can be considered a unit, interacting with the surface stream. Groups of these stream-sandbar units form a higher level, the reach. At the next higher scale, sandy reaches (runs) alternate with riffles. Where flowpaths converge, rates of N tra!},

abstract = {Stream ecosystems consist of several subsystems that are spatially distributed concentrically, analogous to the elements of a simple telescope. Subsystems include the central surface stream, vertically and laterally arrayed saturated sediments (hyporheic and parafluvial zones), and the most distal element, the riparian zone. These zones are hydrologically connected; thus water and its dissolved and suspended load move through all of these subsystems as it flows downstream. In any given subsystem, chemical transformations result in a change in the quantity of materials in transport. Processing length is the length of subsystem required to "process" an amount of substrate equal to advective input. Long processing lengths reflect low rates of material cycling. Processing length provides the length dimension of each cylindrical element of the telescope and is specific to subsystem (for example, the surface stream), substrate (for instance, nitrate), and process (denitrification, for example). Disturbance causes processing length to increase. Processing length decreases during succession following disturbance. The whole stream-corridor ecosystem consists of several nested cylindrical elements that extend and retract, much as would a telescope, in response to disturbance regime. This telescoping ecosystem model (TEM) can improve understanding of material retention in running water systems; that is, their "nutrient filtration" capacity. We hypothesize that disturbance by flooding alters this capacity in proportion to both intensity of disturbance and to the relative effect of disturbance on each subsystem. We would expect more distal subsystems (for example, the riparian zone) to show the highest resistance to floods. fn contrast, we predict that postflood recovery of functions such as material processing (that is, resilience) will be highest in central elements and decrease laterally. Resistance and resilience of subsystems are thus both inversely correlated and spatially separated. We further hypothesize that cross-linkages between adjacent subsystems will enhance resilience of the system as a whole. Whole-ecosystem retention transformation, and transport are thus viewed as a function of subsystem extent, lateral and vertical linkage, and disturbance regime.},

abstract = {We assessed biogeochemical cycling of elements through residential household landscapes to evaluate the importance of annual to decadal household-level decisions for element fluxes that contribute to urban and regional pollution. We combined a mailed survey, vegetation measurements, and allometric and biogeochemical models to estimate fluxes and accumulation of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in landscapes of 360 single-family homes in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota metropolitan area. Carbon inputs and accumulation were strongly influenced by the presence of trees on the property. Nitrogen inputs to the landscape exceeded estimated ecosystem demand for N on average by 51{\%} and were dominated by N fertilizer application. Because Minnesota state law restricts the use of P fertilizer, pet waste was responsible for 84{\%} of P inputs to the landscape. The results have implications for understanding sources of urban pollution and the potential flexibility (i.e., the potential for change) in household behaviors such as tree planting, fertilization, and pet waste management that contribute to such pollution.},

EPS are mainly polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids and lipids; they provide the mechanical stability of biofilms, mediate their adhesion to surfaces and form a cohesive, three-dimensional polymer network that interconnects and transiently immobilizes biofilm cells. In addition, the biofilm matrix acts as an external digestive system by keeping extracellular enzymes close to the cells, enabling them to metabolize dissolved, colloidal and solid biopolymers. Here we describe the functions, properties and constituents of the EPS matrix that make biofilms the most successful forms of life on earth.},

abstract = {We spend the majority of our lives indoors where we are constantly exposed to bacteria residing on surfaces. However, the diversity of these surface-associated communities is largely unknown. We explored the biogeographical patterns exhibited by bacteria across ten surfaces within each of twelve public restrooms. Using high-throughput barcoded pyrosequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene, we identified 19 bacterial phyla across all surfaces. Most sequences belonged to four phyla: Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The communities clustered into three general categories: those found on surfaces associated with toilets, those on the restroom floor, and those found on surfaces routinely touched with hands. On toilet surfaces, gut-associated taxa were more prevalent, suggesting fecal contamination of these surfaces. Floor surfaces were the most diverse of all communities and contained several taxa commonly found in soils. Skin-associated bacteria, especially the Propionibacteriaceae, dominated surfaces routinely touched with our hands. Certain taxa were more common in female than in male restrooms as vagina-associated Lactobacillaceae were widely distributed in female restrooms, likely from urine contamination. Use of the SourceTracker algorithm confirmed many of our taxonomic observations as human skin was the primary source of bacteria on restroom surfaces. Overall, these results demonstrate that restroom surfaces host relatively diverse microbial communities dominated by human-associated bacteria with clear linkages between communities on or in different body sites and those communities found on restroom surfaces. More generally, this work is relevant to the public health field as we show that human-associated microbes are commonly found on restroom surfaces suggesting that bacterial pathogens could readily be transmitted between individuals by the touching of surfaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can use high-throughput analyses of bacterial communities to determine sources of bacteria on indoor surfaces, an approach which could be used to track pathogen transmission and test the efficacy of hygiene practices.},

abstract = {While poleward species migration in response to recent climatic warming is widely documented, few studies have examined entire range responses of broadly distributed sessile organisms, including changes on both the trailing (equatorward) and the leading (poleward) range edges. From a detailed population census throughout the entire geographical range of Aloe dichotoma Masson, a long-lived Namib Desert tree, together with data from repeat photographs, we present strong evidence that a developing range shift in this species is a 'fingerprint' of anthropogenic climate change. This is explained at a high level of statistical significance by population level impacts of observed regional warming and resulting water balance constraints. Generalized linear models suggest that greater mortalities and population declines in equatorward populations are virtually certainly the result, due to anthropogenic climate change, of the progressive exceedance of critical climate thresholds that are relatively closer to the species' tolerance limits in equatorward sites. Equatorward population declines are also broadly consistent with bioclimatically modelled projections under anticipated anthropogenic climate change but, as yet, there is no evidence of poleward range expansion into the area predicted to become suitable in future, despite good evidence for positive population growth trends in poleward populations. This study is among the first to show a marked lag between trailing edge population extinction and leading edge range expansion in a species experiencing anthropogenic climate change impacts, a pattern likely to apply to most sessile and poorly dispersed organisms. This provides support for conservative assumptions of species' migration rates when modelling climate change impacts for such species. Aloe dichotoma's response to climate change suggests that desert ecosystems may be more sensitive to climate change than previously suspected},

Worldwide changes to forests, farmlands, waterways, and air are being driven by the need to provide food, fiber, water, and shelter to more than six billion people. Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases.

abstract = {The resilience perspective is increasingly used as an approach for understanding the dynamics of social-ecological systems. This article presents the origin of the resilience perspective and provides an overview of its development to date. With roots in one branch of ecology and the discovery of multiple basins of attraction in ecosystems in the 1960-1970s, it inspired social and environmental scientists to challenge the dominant stable equilibrium view. The resilience approach emphasizes non-linear dynamics, thresholds, uncertainty and surprise, how periods of gradual change interplay with periods of rapid change and how such dynamics interact across temporal and spatial scales. The history was dominated by empirical observations of ecosystem dynamics interpreted in mathematical models, developing into the adaptive management approach for responding to ecosystem change. Serious attempts to integrate the social dimension is currently taking place in resilience work reflected in the large numbers of sciences involved in explorative studies and new discoveries of linked social-ecological systems. Recent advances include understanding of social processes like, social learning and social memory, mental models and knowledge-system integration, visioning and scenario building, leadership, agents and actor groups, social networks, institutional and organizational inertia and change, adaptive capacity, transformability and systems of adaptive governance that allow for management of essential ecosystem services. ?? 2006.},

Once described as healthy and dominated by various marine predators, the Black Sea ecosystem by the late 20th century had experienced anthropogenic impacts such as heavy fishing, cultural eutrophication, and invasions by alien species. We studied changes related to these "natural experiments" to reveal the mechanisms of regime shifts. Two major shifts were detected, the first related to a depletion of marine predators and the second to an outburst of the alien comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi; both shifts were triggered by intense fishing resulting in system-wide trophic cascades. The complex nature of ecosystem responses to human activities calls for more elaborate approaches than currently provided by traditional environmental and fisheries management. This implies challenging existing practices and implementing explanatory models of ecosystem interactions that can better reconcile conservation and ecosystem management ideals.},

Although time series analysis has helped to validate the relative importance of these two explanations, very little of this theory has been confirmed by experiment. Here, we demonstrate the dual synchronizing effect of dispersal and temporal environmental varia- tion. We used an experimental model system based on the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and its algal prey Chlorella vulgaris. We constructed temporal prey fluctuations with two periodic components that matched the generation time and life span of the rotifer. By varying the amplitude of these two periods we created prey variability with "white" (both periods had equal power) and "red" (the longest period had greatest power) spectra. In the absence of dispersal only the red fluctuations induced synchrony in the population dynamics of the rotifer. Dispersal had a strong and rapid synchronizing effect. The combination of red (but not white) fluctuations and dispersal resulted in the highest levels of synchrony. These results confirm the predictions of recent theory, but they also suggest that the temporal structure of environmental variability determines its capacity to synchronize population namics; synchrony. dynamics over large spatial scales.},

Studies that use a network approach to study the structure and dynamics of communities of interacting species have revealed many patterns and associated processes. Historically these studies were restricted to trophic interactions, although network approaches are now used to study a wide range of interactions, including for example the reproductive mutualisms. However, each interaction type remains studied largely in isolation from others. Merging the various interaction types within a single integrative framework is necessary if we want to further our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of communities. Dividing the networks up is a methodological convenience as in the field the networks occur together in space and time and will be linked by shared species. Herein, we outline a conceptual framework for studying networks composed of more than one type of interaction, highlighting key questions and research areas that would benefit from their study.},

abstract = {Seeds respond to environmental signals, tuning their dormancy cycles to the seasons and thereby determining the optimum time for plant establishment. The molecular regulation of dormancy cycling is unknown, but an extensive range of mechanisms have been identified in laboratory experiments. Using a targeted investigation of gene expression over the dormancy cycle of Arabidopsis seeds in the field, we investigated how these mechanisms are seasonally coordinated. Depth of dormancy and gene expression patterns were correlated with seasonal changes in soil temperature. The results were consistent with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling linked to deep dormancy in winter being repressed in spring concurrent with enhanced DELLA repression of germination as depth of dormancy decreased. Dormancy increased during winter as soil temperature declined and expression of ABA synthesis (NCED6) and gibberellic acid (GA) catabolism (GA2ox2) genes increased. This was linked to an increase in endogenous ABA that plateaus, but dormancy and DOG1 and MFT expression continued to increase. The expression of SNF1-related protein kinases, SnrK 2.1 and 2.4, also increased consistent with enhanced ABA signaling and sensitivity being modulated by seasonal soil temperature. Dormancy then declined in spring and summer. Endogenous ABA decreased along with positive ABA signaling as expression of ABI2, ABI4, and ABA catabolism (CYP707A2) and GA synthesis (GA3ox1) genes increased. However, during the low-dormancy phase in the summer, expression of transcripts for the germination repressors RGA and RGL2 increased. Unlike deep winter dormancy, this represson can be removed on exposure to light, enabling the completion of germination at the correct time of year.},

To test this, we manipulated both rates of habitat connectivity and the geometric arrangement of habitat heterogeneity within regions of experimental zooplankton communities, We found no effects of habitat geometry on an metric of species diversity or composition. Additionally, e found no effect of habitat connectivity rate on local species diversity. We did, however, find that increasing connectivity led to a decrease in regional diversity, as well as an increase in the percent similarity of local communities within regions. Of all of the species in these communities, the relatively large cladoceran Ceriodaphnia reticulata significantly responded to the treatments, and had a higher probability of achieving high densities when connectance was high. As such, A e suggest that this species played a large role in driving the increased local community similarity and decreased regional species richness as connectivity increased. These findings are in opposition to previous experimental studies of metacommunities, but support the notion that increased connectance among local patches may decrease regional diversity when patched are heterogeneous},

abstract = {The role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the trophic dynamics of aquatic systems is difficult to study. One approach is to focus on the activity of the extracellular enzyme systems that heterotrophic bacteria use to obtain nutrients from DOM. These data are easy to acquire, but difficult to interpret, because we lack general models that relate these activities to the two sides of the trophic reaction: the DOM pool and bacterial production. To address this gap, we collected water samples from the Maumee River on nine dates from May 1996 through November 1996. The water was filtered and placed in bottles to which a variety of substrates were added (final concentration 20 µM unless otherwise noted): ammonium, leucine, albumin (1 mg liter-1), glucose, cellobiose, starch (1 mg liter-l), vanillin, and tannin (2 mg liter-1). After 20 h at ambient river temperature, respiration, productivity, growth efficiency, and the activities of a-glucosidase, P-glucosidase, leucine aminopeptidase, phosphatase, and esterase were measured. The glucosidases were the most responsive enzymes, followed by phosphatase and peptidase. Saccharide and albumin additions produced the largest increases in production and growth efficiency. Phenolic amendments generally depressed growth efficiency. The results suggest that production was primarily carbon limited: Peptides appeared to be a major component of the diet, but high productivities were associated with the availability of saccharides. During the summer, production appeared to be fueled by lysates and exudates generated through the microbial loop. Lower ratios of productivity (e.g., enzyme activity and positive metabolic responses to phenols) suggested that allochthonous carbon may have been important during spring and autumn.},

Three different types of subsampling designs (random, systematic and systematic-cluster) with small sample sizes (50 and 64 points), obtained from this larger data set (200 points), are evaluated. The sensitivity of the spatial methods in the detection and the reconstruction of spatial patterns following the application of the various subsampling designs is discussed. We find that the type of sampling design plays an important role in the capacity of autocorrelation coefficients to detect significant spatial autocorrelation, and in the ability to accurately reconstruct spatial patterns by kriging. Sampling designs that contain varying sampling steps, like random and systematic-cluster designs, seem more capable of detecting spatial structures than a systematic design.},

abstract = {Recognition of the importance of land-use history and its legacies in most ecological systems has been a major factor driving the recent focus on human activity as a legitimate and essential subject of environmental science. Ecologists, conservationists, and natural resource policymakers now recognize that the legacies of land-use activities continue to influence ecosystem structure and function for decades or centuries—or even longer—after those activities have ceased. Consequently, recognition of these historical legacies adds explanatory power to our understanding of modern conditions at scales from organisms to the globe and reduces missteps in anticipating or managing for future conditions. As a result, environmental history emerges as an integral part of ecological science and conservation planning. By considering diverse ecological phenomena, ranging from biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles to ecosystem resilience to anthropogenic stress, and by examining terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in temperate to tropical biomes, this article demonstrates the ubiquity and importance of land-use legacies to environmental science and management.},

abstract = {Species distribution in a metacommunity varies according to their traits, the distribution of environmental conditions and connectivity among localities. These ingredients contribute to coexistence across spatial scales via species sorting, patch dynamics, mass effects and neutral dynamics. These mechanisms however seldom act in isolation and the impact of landscape configuration on their relative importance remains poorly understood. We present a new model of metacommunity dynamics that simultaneously considers these four possible mechanisms over spatially explicit landscapes and propose a statistical approach to partition their contribution to species distribution. We find that landscape configuration can induce dispersal limitations that have negative consequences for local species richness. This result was more pronounced with neutral dynamics and mass effect than with species sorting or patch dynamics. We also find that the relative importance of the four mechanisms varies not only among landscape configurations, but also among species, with some species being mostly constrained by dispersal and/or drift and others by sorting. Changes in landscape properties might lead to a shift in coexistence mechanisms and, by extension, to a change in community composition. This confirms the importance of considering landscape properties for conservation and management. Our results illustrate the idea that ecological communities are the results of multiple mechanisms acting at the same time and complete our understanding of spatial processes in competitive metacommunities.This article is protected by copyright.

The IDH states that diversity of competing species is, or should be expected to be, maximized at intermediate frequencies and/or intensities of disturbance or environmental change. I argue that the IDH has been refuted on both empirical and theoretical grounds, and so should be abandoned. Empirical studies only rarely find the predicted humped diversity-disturbance relationship. Theoretically, the three major mechanisms thought to produce humped diversity-disturbance relationships are logically invalid and do not actually predict what they are thought to predict.

abstract = {1. Both environmental filtering and dispersal filtering are known to influence plant species distribution patterns and biodiversity. Particularly in dynamic habitats, however, it remains unclear whether environmental filtering (stimulated by stressful conditions) or dispersal filtering (during recolonization events) dominates in community assembly, or how they interact. Such a fundamental understanding of community assembly is critical to the design of biodiversity conservation and restoration strategies. 2. Stream riparian zones are species-rich dynamic habitats. They are characterized by steep hydrological gradi- ents likely to promote environmental filtering, and by spatiotemporal variation in the arrival of propagules likely to promote dispersal filtering. We quantified the contributions of both filters by monitoring natural seed arrival (dispersal filter) and experimentally assessing germination, seedling survival and growth of 17 riparian plant species (environmental filter) along riparian gradients of three lowland streams that were excavated to bare sub- strate for restoration. Subsequently, we related spatial patterns in each process to species distribution and diver- sity patterns after 1 and 2 years of succession. 3. Patterns in initial seed arrival were very clearly reflected in species distribution patterns in the developing vegetation and were more significant than environmental filtering. However, environmental filtering intensified towards the wet end of the riparian gradient, particularly through effects of flooding on survival and growth, which strongly affected community diversity and generated a gradient in the vegetation. Strikingly, patterns in seed arrival foreshadowed the gradient that developed in the vegetation; seeds of species with adult optima at wetter conditions dominated seed arrival at low elevations along the riparian gradient, while seeds of species with drier optima arrived higher up. Despite previous assertions suggesting a dominance of environmental filter- ing, our results demonstrate that non-random dispersal may be an important driver of early successional riparian vegetation zonation and biodiversity patterns as well. 4. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate (and quantify) the strong roles of both environmental and dispersal filter- ing in determining plant community assemblies in early successional dynamic habitats. Furthermore, we demon- strate that dispersal filtering can already initiate vegetation gradients, a mechanism that may have been overlooked along many environmental gradients where interspecific interactions are (temporarily) reduced.},

Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, from June, 2003 to June, 2004. Thirty to forty years after harvest, macroinvertebrate density and richness did not differ among streams through young growth and old growth. Effects of deciduous riparian vegetation, including seasonal canopy openings and litterfall, continue to influence patterns of macroinvertebrate responses to forest harvest, as shown by higher densities of shredders in young-growth sites, the timing of emergence within basin pairs, and assemblage differences in two of the pairs of basins. The paired-basin design helped in distinguishing the specific influences of forest age from natural variability of macroinvertebrate distributions within the 5th order Lookout Creek basin. Our study suggests that understanding how macroinvertebrates respond to historical disturbances is enhanced by measures sensitive to changes in life history, such as rates of emergence, and to functional composition that reflect resource availability.},

abstract = {Over the past four decades, several authors have stressed that it is not just good performance, on the average, that matters in evolution but that variation in performance also plays an important role in determining long-term evolutionary trends. Several independent lines of research have arisen from considering differ- ent kinds of variation. Dempster (1955) introduced a model in which temporal fluctuations in reproductive success for competing genotypes favor the genotype with the highest geometric-mean reproductive success. Levene (1953) studied a case in which the relative success of alleles varies spatially within a generation. These two papers established the dichotomy between temporal and spatial varia- tion that most authors continue to use. Gillespie (1974a) considered still another kind of variation, variation in the reproductive success of each individual, in which the amount of variation depends on factors such as developmental homeo- stasis. Gillespie's (1974a) model has led to extensive discussion of the idea of evolutionary "bet hedging" (Slatkin 1974; Seger and Brockmann 1987).},

abstract = {Forest managers need a comprehensive scientific understanding of natural stand development processes when designing silvicultural systems that integrate ecological and economic objectives, including a better appreciation of the nature of disturbance regimes and the biological legacies, such as live trees, snags, and logs, that they leave behind. Most conceptual forest development models do not incorporate current knowledge of the: (1) complexity of structures (including spatial patterns) and developmental processes; (2) duration of development in long-lived forests; (3) complex spatial patterns of stands that develop in later stages of seres; and particularly (4) the role of disturbances in creating structural legacies that become key elements of the post-disturbance stands. We elaborate on existing models for stand structural development using natural stand development of the Douglas-fir - western hemlock sere in the Pacific Northwest as our primary example; most of the principles are broadly applicable while some processes (e.g. role of epicormic branches) are related to specific species. We discuss the use of principles from disturbance ecology and natural stand development to create silvicultural approaches that are more aligned with natural processes. Such approaches provide for a greater abundance of standing dead and down wood and large old trees, perhaps reducing short-term commercial productivity but ultimately enhancing wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and ecosystem function, including soil protection and nutrient retention. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Community composition within the human microbiome varies across individuals, but it remains unknown if this variation is sufficient to uniquely identify individuals within large populations or stable enough to identify them over time. We investigated this by developing a hitting set-based coding algorithm and applying it to the Human Microbiome Project population. Our approach defined body site-specificmetagenomic codes: sets of microbial taxa or genes prioritized to uniquely and stably identify individuals. Codes capturing strain variation in clade-specific marker genes were able to distinguish among 100s of individuals at an initial sampling time point. In comparisons with follow-up samples collected 30–300d later, ∼30{\%} of individuals could still be uniquely pinpointed using meta- genomic codes from a typical body site; coincidental (false positive) matcheswere rare. Codes based on the gutmicrobiome were excep- tionally stable and pinpointed {\textgreater}80{\%} of individuals. The failure of a code to match its owner at a later time point was largely explained by the loss of specificmicrobial strains (at current limits of detection) and was only weakly associated with the length of the sampling interval. In addition to highlighting patterns of temporal variation in the ecology of the human microbiome, this work demonstrates the feasibility of microbiome-based identifiability—a result with important ethical implications for microbiome study design.

abstract = {[1] We conducted a detailed study of subsurface flow and water table response coupled with digital terrain analysis (DTA) of surface and subsurface features at the hillslope scale in Panola Mountain Research Watershed (PMRW), Georgia. Subsurface storm flow contributions of macropore and matrix flow in different sections along an artificial trench face were highly variable in terms of timing, peak flow, recession characteristics, and total flow volume. The trench flow characteristics showed linkages with the spatial tensiometer response defining water table development upslope. DTA of the ground surface did not capture the observed spatial patterns of trench flow or tensiometric response. However, bedrock surface topographic indices significantly improved the estimation of spatial variation of flow at the trench. Point-scale tensiometric data were also more highly correlated with the bedrock surface-based indices. These relationships were further assessed for temporal changes throughout a rainstorm. Linkages between the bedrock indices and the trench flow and spatial water table responses improved during the wetter periods of the rainstorm, when the hillslope became more hydrologically connected. Our results clearly demonstrate that in developing a conceptual framework for understanding the mechanisms of runoff generation, local bedrock topography may be highly significant at the hillslope scale in some catchments where the bedrock surface acts as a relatively impermeable boundary.},

My results agree with evolutionary models and correlations found previously between habitat stability and individual dispersal propensity in nature.

This article presents a frame-work for a hierarchical classification system, entailing an organized view of spatial and temporal variation among and within stream systems. Stream habitat systems, defined and classified on several spatiotemporal scales, are associated with watershed geomorphic features and events. Variables selected for classification define relative long-term capacities of systems, not simply short-term states. Streams and their watershed environments are classified within the context of a regional biogeoclimatic landscape classification. The framework is a perspective that should allow more systematic interpretation and description of watershed-stream relationships.},

abstract = {Dispersal and the underlying movement behaviour are processes of pivotal importance for understanding and predicting metapopulation and metacommunity dynamics. Generally, dispersal decisions are condition-dependent and rely on information in the broad sense, like the presence of conspecifics. However, studies on metacommunities that include interspecific interactions generally disregard condition-dependence. Therefore, it remains unclear whether and how dispersal in metacommunities is condition-dependent and whether rules derived from single-species contexts can be scaled up to (meta)communities. Using experimental protist metacommunities, we show how dispersal and movement depend on and are adjusted by the strength of interspecific interactions. We found that the predicting movement and dispersal in metacommunities requires knowledge on behavioural responses to intra- and interspecific interaction strengths. Consequently, metacommunity dynamics inferred directly from single-species metapopulations without taking interspecific interactions into account are likely flawed. Our work identifies the significance of condition-dependence for understanding metacommunity dynamics, stability and the coexistence and distribution of species.},

@article{Fronhofer2012,
abstract = {Roughly 40 years after its introduction, the metapopulation concept is central to population ecology. The notion that local populations and their dynamics may be coupled by dispersal is without any doubt of great importance for our understanding of population-level processes. A metapopulation describes a set of subpopulations linked by (rare) dispersal events in a dynamic equilibrium of extinctions and recolonizations. In the large body of literature that has accumulated, the term “metapopulation” is often used in a very broad sense; most of the time it simply implies spatial heterogeneity. A number of reviews have recently addressed this problem and have pointed out that, despite the large and still growing popularity of the metapopulation concept, there are only very few empirical examples that conform with the strict classical metapopulation (CM) definition. In order to understand this discrepancy between theory and observation, we use an individual-based modeling approach that allows us to pinpoint the environmental conditions and the life-history attributes required for the emergence of a CM structure. We find that CM dynamics are restricted to a specific parameter range at the border between spatially structured but completely occupied and globally extinct populations. Considering general life-history attributes, our simulations suggest that CMs are more likely to occur in arthropod species than in (large) vertebrates. Since the specific type of spatial population structure determines conservation concepts, our findings have important implications for conservation biology. Our model suggests that most spatially structured populations are panmictic, patchy, or of mainland–island type, which makes efforts spent on increasing connectivity (e.g., corridors) questionable. If one does observe a true CM structure, this means that the focal metapopulation is on the brink of extinction and that drastic conservation measures are needed.

The mechanisms of priority effects fall into two categories, niche preemption and niche modification, and the condi- tions for historical contingency by priority effects can be organized into two groups, those regarding regional species pool properties and those regarding local population dynamics. Specifically, two requirements must be satisfied for historical contingency to occur: The regional pool contains species that can together cause priority effects, and local dynamics are rapid enough for early-arriving species to preempt or modify niches before other species arrive. Organizing current knowledge this way reveals an outstanding key question:How are regional species pools that yield priority effects generated and maintained?},

abstract = {Identification of the causes of productivity-species diversity relationships remains a central topic of ecological research. Different relations have been attributed to the influence of disturbance, consumers, niche specialization and spatial scale. One unexplored cause is the history of community assembly, the partly stochastic sequential arrival of species from a regional pool of potential community members. The sequence of species arrival can greatly affect community structure. If assembly sequence interacts with productivity to influence diversity, different sequences can contribute to variation in productivity-diversity relationships. Here we report a test of this hypothesis by assembling aquatic microbial communities at five productivity levels using four assembly sequences. About 30 generations after assembly, productivity-diversity relationships took various forms, including a positive, a hump-shaped, a U-shaped and a non-significant pattern, depending on assembly sequence. This variation resulted from idiosyncratic joint effects of assembly sequence, productivity and species identity on species abundances. We suggest that the history of community assembly should be added to the growing list of factors that influence productivity-biodiversity patterns.},

We examined how extinctions in a heterogeneous landscape of patches affects the influence of environmental, spatial and stochastic factors on community composition in a simple two-species two-habitat protist metacommunity where each species dominates in a different habitat type. We imposed four different levels of random extinctions on local patches and monitored changes in the metacommunity through time.

abstract = {1. We review theoretical and empirical studies to identify instances where evolutionary processes significantly affect the dynamics of populations, communities and ecosystems. 2. Early theoretical work on eco-evolutionary dynamics was concerned with the effect of (co)evolution on the stability of two-species predator–prey systems and the occurrence of character displacement in simple competitive systems. Today's theoretical ecologists are extending this work to study the eco-evolutionary dynamics of multispecies communities and the functioning and evolutionary emergence of ecosystems. 3. In terms of methodology, eco-evolutionary modelling has diversified from simple, locus-based population genetic models to encompass models of clonal selection, quantitative trait dynamics and adaptive dynamics. 4. The few empirical studies on community dynamics that explicitly considered evolutionary processes support the view that evolutionary and ecological dynamics often occur on similar time-scales, and that they co-determine the dynamical behaviour of ecological communities.},

abstract = {Microevolution is typically ignored as a factor directly affecting ongoing population dynamics. We show here that density-dependent natural selection has a direct and measurable effect on a planktonic predator-prey interaction. We kept populations of Brachionus calyciflorus, a monogonont rotifer that exhibits cyclical parthenogenesis, in continuous flow-through cultures (chemostats) for more than 900 days. Initially, females frequently produced male offspring, especially at high population densities. We observed rapid evolution, however, towards low propensity to reproduce sexually, and by 750 days, reproduction had become entirely asexual. There was strong selection favouring asexual reproduction because, under the turbulent chemostat regime, males were unable to mate with females, produced no offspring, and so had zero fitness. In replicated chemostat experiments we found that this evolutionary process directly influenced the population dynamics. We observed very specific but reproducible plankton dynamics which are explained well by a mathematical model that explicitly includes evolution. This model accounts for both asexual and sexual reproduction and treats the propensity to reproduce sexually as a quantitative trait under selection. We suggest that a similar amalgam of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms may drive the dynamics of rapidly reproducing organisms in the wild.},

abstract = {Cycling of phosphorus at the sediment-water interface is traditionally considered to be controlled by pH- and redox-dependent, abiotic processes, such as formation and dissolution of FeOOH-PO4 complexes. In this study, however, a large part of total P in sediments of Lake Sempach, an 87-m deep eutrophic lake, was estimated to be incorporated in bacterial biomass. Laboratory experiments indicated that sediment microorganisms can rapidly take up and release soluble reactive P (SRP), depending on redox conditions, and that sterilization of oxic sediments decreased their SRP sorption capacity. In an in situ experiment conducted in the lake, bacteria also contributed considerably to SRP fixation when water enclosed within a sediment flux chamber was reoxygenated following anoxia. Moreover, in that experiment and in data sets from several other lakes, anoxic releases of Fe and P from sediments appeared to be partly uncoupled. As part of an ongoing revision of the classical model for P exchange across the sediment-water interface, these results provide direct evidence that fixation and release of SRP may be controlled partly by redox-dependent changes in microbial physiology, as well as by production and decomposition of microbial biomass.},

A theoretical investigation of the phenomenon of dispersal suggests the following consequences: Isolated and poorly accessible sites will tend to become less crowded than an average site as a result of dispersal. An episode of dispersal will result in uneven crowding at the various sites. Variation in the degree of crowding resulting from dispersal will depress the total population size of a species over its entire range. Variation in the carrying capacity with time will lead to an analogous depression of the mean population size. Spatial variation in the carrying capacities of the sites will favor a sensitive response leading to a rapid increase in the emigration rate with crowding, while variation with time will disfavor a response very sensitive to crowding. Variation in space will favor the emigration of a small fraction of the population, while variation in time will favor the emigration of a larger fraction.},

abstract = {Field studies demonstrate that the population structure of the barnacle Balanus glandula differs between locations of high and low larval settlement rate. These observations, together with results from a model for the demography of an open, space-limited population, suggest that the settlement rate may be a more important determinant of rocky intertidal community structure than is presently realized. Locations with a low larval settlement rate exhibit a generally low abundance of barnacles that varies slightly within years and greatly between years, reflecting yearly differences in settlement. Locations with a high-settlement rate exhibit a generally high abudance of barnacles. However, the abundance varies greatly within years with a significant oscillatory component (period, 30 weeks) and only slightly between years regardless of yearly differences in settlement. At the low-settlement location mortality of barnacles is independent of the area occupied by barnacles. At the high-settlement location mortality is cover-dependent due to increased predation by starfish on areas of high barnacle cover. In both locations the cover-independent component of mortality does not vary with age during the first 60 weeks. As assumed in the demographic model, the kinetics of larval settlement can be described as a process in which the rate of settlement to a quadrat is proportional to the fraction of vacant space within the quadrat. Generalizations that the highest species diversity in a rocky intertidal community is found at locations of intermediate disturbance, and that competition causes zonation between species of the barnacle genera Balanus and Chthamalus, seem to apply only to locations with high-settlement rates.},

We contrast different modelling approaches and indicate how details in the way we model each step of a life cycle can have important consequences on the predicted probability of evolutionary emergence. These different theoretical perspectives yield important insights into optimal surveillance and intervention strategies, which should aim for a reduction in the emergence (and re-emergence) of infectious diseases.},

abstract = {"Environmental data are spatial, temporal, and often come with many zeros. In this paper, we included space-time random effects in zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and 'hurdle' models to investigate haulout patterns of harbor seals on glacial ice. The data consisted of counts, for 18 dates on a lattice grid of samples, of harbor seals hauled out on glacial ice in Disenchantment Bay, near Yakutat, Alaska. A hurdle model is similar to a ZIP model except it does not mix zeros from the binary and count processes. Both models can be used for zero-inflated data, and we compared space-time ZIP and hurdle models in a Bayesian hierarchical model. Space-time ZIP and hurdle models were constructed by using spatial conditional autoregressive (CAR) models and temporal first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) models as random effects in ZIP and hurdle regression models. We created maps of smoothed predictions for harbor seal counts based on ice density, other covariates, and spatio-temporal random effects. For both models predictions around the edges appeared to be positively biased. The linex loss function is an asymmetric loss function that penalizes overprediction more than underprediction, and we used it to correct for prediction bias to get the best map for space-time ZIP and hurdle models.},

@article{Gaston2005,
abstract = {To our minds, the last decade has seen at least two highly significant broad theoretical developments that address the core principles of ecology. The first of these has been the theory of metabolic scaling developed by G. B. West, J. H. Brown, B. J. Enquist and their col-leagues. Based on the premise that metabolic rate is the most fundamental biological rate process, a large and growing body of work has sought to explore how, through geometrical constraints on exchange surfaces and distribution networks, relationships arise between body size and metabolic rate (West, Brown {\&} Enquist 1997, 1999a,b; Gillooly et al. 2001; West, Woodruff {\&} Brown 2002), developmental time (Gillooly et al. 2002), population growth rate (Savage et al. 2004), abundance and biomass (Enquist {\&} Niklas 2001), production and population energy use (Ernest et al. 2003), and species diversity (Allen, Brown {\&} Gillooly 2002). Whilst some of this work remains contentious (e.g. Dodds, Rothman {\&} Weitz 2001; Koz l owski, Konarzewski {\&} Gawelczyk 2003; Ricklefs 2003a; Storch 2003), the links to many of the topics routinely addressed by research papers published in Functional Ecology are obvious, and led to a recent special forum in the journal (Volume 18, Number 2) being dedicated to the topic. Indeed, much of the metabolic scaling research and numerous papers in the journal fall comfortably within the field of mac-rophysiology, which has been defined as 'the investiga-tion of variation in physiological traits over large geographic and temporal scales and the ecological implications of this variation' (Chown, Gaston {\&} Robinson 2004). The second significant broad theo-retical development in ecology has been the neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography proposed and championed by S.P. Hubbell (1979, 1997, 2001). This builds on the foundations of the classical theory of island biogeography, based on an assumption of demo-graphic neutrality of individuals, to explain patterns of species richness, abundance and distribution. The con-nections between this work and the research typically published in Functional Ecology may perhaps be less apparent to many of the journal's readers. However, we suggest that these connections may, in practice, be equally strong as those to the theory of metabolic scaling. Indeed, there may also be much that can be gained from a joint consideration of the two theoretical developments, especially the interaction between those processes responsible for large-scale spatial variation in the numbers of individuals in a community or meta-community (Allen et al. 2002), and those that produce the characteristics of many local communities that are a function of dispersal, speciation rate and numbers of individuals (the neutral theory) (see also Hubbell {\&} Lake 2003). For these reasons, the present issue of the journal contains a second special forum, this time devoted to the neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography. In this editorial, we briefly explore some of the reasons that the neutral theory is likely to be particularly relevant to functional ecology.},

Here I consider a system of Daphnia and two potential prey; one prey termed primary algae, which are preferentially consumed, and the other secondary algae, which yield less nutrition and are more resistant to the grazer. The presence of secondary algae is a key to the stability, but their nutritional value has not been clearly defined in the previous theory and the actual value varies. Here I use a simple mathematical model defining explicitly the nutritional values of algae and examine the stability of the systems as a function of phosphorus enrichment. Whether or not all three species can stably coexist depended on the combination of the algal species used for simulation. In systems where all the species coexist in a stable manner, in which enrichment does not necessarily lead to destabilization, there is always a critical nutritional value of the secondary algae. Empirical work supports the possibility that the unknown nutritional value of secondary algae takes a value close to the critical one. Furthermore, at the critical nutritional value, the population response in the systems to enrichment is consistent with the observed trend in natural systems. This suggests that Daphnia-algal systems in nature can maintain stability in the face of enrichment, without requiring specific assumptions such as spatial heterogeneity.},

A theoretical model of a predator–prey system with a natural assumption of satiation in predation predicts that enrichment causes the populations to fluctuate to stochastic extinction. However, this 'paradox of enrichment' does not always occur in experimental and natural communities. Here we present a theoretical model that describes a novel mechanism for resolving the paradox in the case of a predator with optimal selective feeding. Specifically, a less profitable but edible (thus `unpalatable') prey species sharply reduces the amplitude of population oscillations and firmly prevents the minimum abundances of species from falling below certain values. The presence of such an unpalatable prey thus guarantees the robustness of the system against enrichment.},

The response in the abundance of the more profitable (more vulnerable) prey to enrichment has, however, remained unclear. Previous theoretical models have assumed the less profitable prey as inedible, though its actual profitability is unknown. Here, relaxing this assumption, we show that the response of the more profitable prey abundance to enrichment depends critically on the profitability of the less profitable prey. Specifically, the more profitable prey increases in abundance with enrichment if the profitability of the less profitable prey is lower than a critical value so that it cannot support the predator population by itself even at high densities (in this case, the prey is referred to as 'unpalatable') and decreases otherwise. This establishes a more general rule which unifies the previous works and resolves the indeterminacy on the response of the more profitable prey.},

abstract = {* The subdiscipline of ‘community phylogenetics' is rapidly growing and influencing thinking regarding community assembly. In particular, phylogenetic dispersion of co-occurring species within a community is commonly used as a proxy to identify which community assembly processes may have structured a particular community: phylogenetic clustering as a proxy for abiotic assembly, that is habitat filtering, and phylogenetic overdispersion as a proxy for biotic assembly, notably competition. * We challenge this approach by highlighting (typically) implicit assumptions that are, in reality, only weakly supported, including (i) phylogenetic dispersion reflects trait dispersion; (ii) a given ecological function can be performed only by a single trait state or combination of trait states; (iii) trait similarity causes enhanced competition; (iv) competition causes species exclusion; (v) communities are at equilibrium with processes of assembly having been completed; (vi) assembly through habitat filtering decreases in importance if assembly through competition increases, such that the relative balance of the two can be thus quantified by a single parameter; and (vii) observed phylogenetic dispersion is driven predominantly by local and present-day processes. * Moreover, technical sophistication of the phylogenetic-patterns-as-proxy approach trades off against sophistication in alternative, potentially more pertinent approaches to directly observe or manipulate assembly processes. * Despite concerns about using phylogenetic dispersion as a proxy for community assembly processes, we suggest there are underappreciated benefits of quantifying the phylogenetic structure of communities, including (i) understanding how coexistence leads to the macroevolutionary diversification of habitat lineage-pools (i.e. phylogenetic-patterns-as-result approach); and (ii) understanding the macroevolutionary contingency of habitat lineage-pools and how it affects present-day species coexistence in local communities (i.e. phylogenetic-patterns-as-cause approach). * We conclude that phylogenetic patterns may be little useful as proxy of community assembly. However, such patterns can prove useful to identify and test novel hypotheses on (i) how local coexistence may control macroevolution of the habitat lineage-pool, for example through competition among close relatives triggering displacement and diversification of characters, and (ii) how macroevolution within the habitat lineage-pool may control local coexistence of related species, for example through origin of close relatives that can potentially enter in competition.},

The relative importance of factors that contribute to the composition of human-dominated BE microbial communities remains largely unknown. In their article in this issue, Chase and colleagues (J. Chase, J. Fouquier, M. Zare, D. L. Sonderegger, R. Knight, S. T. Kelley, J. Siegel, and J. G. Caporaso, mSystems 1(2):e00022-16, 2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mSystems.00022-16 ) present an office building study in which they controlled for environmental factors, geography, surface material, sampling location, and human interaction type. They found that surface location and geography were the strongest factors contributing to microbial community structure, while surface material had little effect. Even in the absence of direct human interaction, BE surfaces were composed of 25 to 30{\%} human skin-associated taxa. The authors demonstrate how technical variation across sequencing runs is a major issue, especially in BE work, where the biomass is often low and the potential for PCR contaminants is high. Overall, the authors conclude that BE surfaces are desert-like environments where microbes passively accumulate.},

abstract = {Human-associated bacteria dominate the built environment (BE). Following decontamination of floors, toilet seats, and soap dispensers in four public restrooms, in situ bacterial communities were characterized hourly, daily, and weekly to determine their successional ecology. The viability of cultivable bacteria, following the removal of dispersal agents (humans), was also assessed hourly. A late-successional community developed within 5 to 8 h on restroom floors and showed remarkable stability over weeks to months. Despite late-successional dominance by skin- and outdoor-associated bacteria, the most ubiquitous organisms were predominantly gut-associated taxa, which persisted following exclusion of humans. Staphylococcus represented the majority of the cultivable community, even after several hours of human exclusion. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-associated virulence genes were found on floors but were not present in assembled Staphylococcus pan-genomes. Viral abundances, which were predominantly enterophages, human papilloma virus, and herpesviruses, were significantly correlated with bacterial abundances and showed an unexpectedly low virus-to-bacterium ratio in surface-associated samples, suggesting that bacterial hosts are mostly dormant on BE surfaces.},

abstract = {A fundamental goal of ecology is to understand what controls the distribution and abundance of species. Both environmental niches and trade-offs among species in dispersal and competitive ability have traditionally been cited as determinants of plant community composition. More recently, neutral models have shown that communities of species with identical life-history characteristics and no adaptation to environmental niches can form spatial distribution patterns similar to those found in nature, so long as the species have a limited dispersal distance. If there is a strong correlation between geographic distance and change in environmental conditions, however, such spatial patterns can arise through either neutral or niche-based processes. To test these competing theories, we developed a sampling design that decoupled distance and environment in the understory plant communities of an old-growth, temperate forest. We found strong evidence of niche-structuring but almost no support for neutral predictions. Dispersal limitation acted in conjunction with environmental gradients to determine species' distributions, and both functional and phylogenetic constraints appear to contribute to the niche differentiation that structures community assembly. Our results indicate that testing a neutral hypothesis without accounting for environmental gradients will at best cause unexplained variation in plant distributions and may well provide misleading support for neutrality because of a correlation between geographic distance and environment.},

Analysis of an adaptive radiation of habitat-associated, polychromatic spiders shows that (i) species assembly is not random; (ii) within any community, similar sets of ecomorphs arise through both dispersal and evolution; and (iii) species assembly is dynamic with maximum species numbers in communities of intermediate age.

abstract = {1.Laboratory microcosm experiments using protists as model organisms have a long tradition and are widely used to investigate general concepts in population biology, community ecology and evolutionary biology. Many variables of interest are measured in order to study processes and patterns at different spatiotemporal scales and across all levels of biological organization. This includes measurements of body size, mobility, or abundance, in order to understand population dynamics, dispersal behaviour, and ecosystem processes. Also, a variety of manipulations are employed, such as temperature changes or varying connectivity in spatial microcosm networks. 2.Past studies, however, have used varying methods for maintenance, measurement, and manipulation, which hinders across-study comparisons and meta-analyses, and the added value they bring. Furthermore, application of techniques such as flow-cytometry, image and video analyses, and in-situ environmental probes provide novel and improved opportunities to quantify variables of interest at unprecedented precision and temporal resolution. 3.Here, we take the first step towards a standardization of well-established and novel methods and techniques within the field of protist microcosm experiments. We provide a comprehensive overview of maintenance, measurement, and manipulation methods. An extensive supplement contains detailed protocols of all methods, and these protocols also exist in a community updateable online repository. 4.We envision that such a synthesis and standardization of methods will overcome shortcomings and challenges faced by past studies, and also promote activities such as meta-analyses and distributed experiments conducted simultaneously across many different laboratories at a global scale.

abstract = {Cultures of Chlamydomonas were exposed to a range of relatively mild stresses for a period of 24 h. These stresses comprised high and low temperatures, osmotic stress, low pH, starvation and toxic stress. They were then allowed to recuperate for around ten vegetative generations under near-optimal conditions in unmodified minimal medium. Fitness was then assayed as the rate of division of isolated cells on agar. We found that there was a strong tendency for stressed cultures to have lower mean fitness and greater standardized variance in fitness than the negative controls which had been cultured throughout in unmodified minimal medium. The same tendency was shown, as expected, by positive controls which received mutagenic doses of ultraviolet irradiation. We concluded that the most reasonable interpretation of these observations is that mild stress increases the genomic rate of mutation. This appears to be the first time that this phenomenon has been noticed in eukaryotes. The response might be adaptive because lineages in which higher mutation rates are elicited by stress can be favourably selected through the production of a few mutants which are fortuitously well adapted to the stressful environment. Other interpretations are not excluded, however. Regardless of the mechanism involved, the elevation of mutation rates under stress will affect the rate of evolutionary response to environmental change and also the maintenance of sexuality.},

Prompted by results from population genetic models and biogeographic observations, we investigate the conditions under which species{\^{a}}€™ borders are attracted to regions of reduced dispersal. For borders maintained by competition or hybridization, we find that dispersal barriers can attract borders whose positions would otherwise be either neutrally stable or moving across space. Borders affected strongly by local adaptation and gene flow, however, are repelled from dispersal barriers. These models illustrate how particular biotic and abiotic factors may combine to limit species{\^{a}}€™ ranges, and they help to elucidate mechanisms by which range limits of many species may coincide.},

abstract = {While spatial synchrony of oscillating populations has been observed in many ecological systems, the causes of this phenomenon are still not well understood. The most common explanations have been the Moran effect (synchronous external stochastic influences) and the effect of dispersal among populations. Since ecological systems are typically subject to large spatially varying perturbations which destroy synchrony, a plausible mechanism explaining synchrony must produce rapid convergence to synchrony. We analyze the dynamics through time of the synchronizing effects of dispersal and, consequently, determine whether dispersal can be the mechanism which produces synchrony. Specifically, using methods new to ecology, we analyze a two patch predator-prey model, with identical weak dispersal between the patches. We find that a difference in time scales (i.e. one population has dynamics occurring much faster than the other) between the predator and prey species is the most important requirement for fast convergence to synchrony.},

abstract = {We examine the effects of density dependence and immigration on local adaptation in a "black-hole sink" habitat, i.e., a habitat in which isolated populations of a species would tend to extinction but where a population is demographically maintained by recurrent one-way migration from a separate source habitat in which the species persists. Using a diploid, one-locus model of a discrete-generation sink population maintained by immigration from a fixed source population, we show that a locally favored allele will spread when rare in the sink if the absolute fitness (or, in some cases, the geometric-mean absolute fitness) of heterozygotes with the favored allele is above one in the sink habitat. With density dependence, the criterion for spread can depend on the rate of immigration, because immigration affects local densities and, hence, absolute fitness. Given the successful establishment of a locally favored allele, it will be maintained by a migration-selection balance and the resulting polymorphic population will be sustained deterministically with either stable or unstable dynamics. The densities of stable polymorphic populations tend to exceed densities that would be maintained in the absence of the favored allele. With strong density regulation, spread of the favored allele may destabilize population dynamics. Our analyses show that polymorphic populations which form subsequent to the establishment of favorable alleles have the capacity to persist deterministically without immigration. Finally, we examined the probabilistic rate at which new favored alleles arise and become established in a sink population. Our results suggest that favored alleles are established most readily at intermediate levels of immigration.},

In this article, we present a prospectus for transferring our basic understanding of evolutionary rescue to wild and other non-laboratory populations. Current experimental and theoretical results emphasize how the interplay between inheritance processes and absolute fitness in changed environments drive population dynamics and determine prospects of extinction. We discuss the challenge of inferring these elements of the evolutionary rescue process in field and natural settings.

abstract = {Species interactions commonly coevolve as complex geographic mosaics of populations shaped by differences in local selection and gene flow. We use a haploid matching-alleles model for coevolution to evaluate how a pair of species coevolves when fitness interactions are reciprocal in some locations ("hot spots") but not in others ("cold spots"). Our analyses consider mutualistic and antagonistic interspecific interactions and a variety of gene flow patterns between hot and cold spots. We found that hot and cold spots together with gene flow influence coevolutionary dynamics in four important ways. First, hot spots need not be ubiquitous to have a global influence on evolution, although rare hot spots will not have a disproportionate impact unless selection is relatively strong there. Second, asymmetries in gene flow can influence local adaptation, sometimes creating stable equilibria at which species experience minimal fitness in hot spots and maximal fitness in cold spots, or vice versa. Third, asymmetries in gene flow are no more important than asymmetries in population regulation for determining the maintenance of local polymorphisms through coevolution. Fourth, intraspecific allele frequency differences among hot and cold spot populations evolve under some, but not all, conditions. That is, selection mosaics are indeed capable of producing spatially variable coevolutionary outcomes across the landscapes over which species interact. Altogether, our analyses indicate that coevolutionary trajectories can be strongly shaped by the geographic distribution of coevolutionary hot and cold spots, and by the pattern of gene flow among populations.},

abstract = {Synthesis Despite theoretical criticisms, the ubiquity of linear relationships between local and regional species richness has long been used to justify it as a valid framework to conclude that local communities are not saturated with species. However, we reanalyzed published studies with a new unbiased method and found no prevalence of linear relationships and more than 40{\%} of misclassifications, including textbook examples. We thus conclude that the prevailing argument in favor of associating a valid ecological interpretation to local–regional species richness plots, its ubiquity, is not sustained, and that ecologists could use for instance metacommunity theory to make inference on the strength of local and regional processes. Identifying the relative importance of regional and local processes to local species diversity is a central issue to many questions in basic and applied ecology. One widely-used method is to plot local species richness against its regional richness to infer whether regional or local processes determine local diversity. However, this method increases the tendency to find regional prevalence as suggested by a recent simulation. We reanalyzed studies in the literature with an unbiased method and found no prevalence of either regional or local processes. In addition, almost 40{\%} of the studies and 50{\%} of the ecology textbook examples using the traditional method were misclassified. Our findings reinforce the need of alternative, novel tools identified by for instance metacommunity theory to go beyond the studies of local–regional relationships in the ecological literature that focus on the interdependence of regional and local processes.},

abstract = {The neutral model posits that random variation in extinction and speciation events, coupled with limited dispersal, can account for many community properties, including the relative abundance distribution. There are important analogies between this model in ecology and a three-tiered hierarchy of models in evolution (Hardy Weinburg, drift, drift and selection). Because it invokes random processes and is used in statistical tests of empirical data, the neutral model can be interpreted as a specialized form of a null model. However, the application and interpretation of neutral models differs from that of standard null models in three important ways: 1) whereas most null models incorporate species-level constraints that are often associated with niche differences, the neutral model assumes that all species are functionally equivalent. 2) Null models are usually fit with constraints that are measured directly from the data set itself. In contrast, the neutral model requires parameters for speciation, extinction, and migration rates that are almost never measured directly, so their values must be guessed at or fitted. 3) Most important, null models are viewed as simple statistical descriptors: unspecified ''random'' forces generate variation in a simple model that excludes particular biological mechanisms (usually species interactions). Although the neutral model was originally framed as a null model, recent proponents of the neutral model have begun to treat it as a literal process-based description of community assembly. These differences lie at the heart of much of the recent controversy over the neutral model. If the neutral model is truly a process-based model, then its assumptions should be directly tested, and its predictions should be compared to those of an appropriate null model. Such tests are rarely informative, and most empirical data sets can be fit more parsimoniously to a simple log-normal distribution. Because unknown parameters in the neutral model must usually be guessed at or fit in ad-hoc ways, classical frequentist tests are compromised, and may be biased towards finding a good fit with the model. There has been little analysis of the potential for type I and type II errors in statistical tests of the neutral model. The neutral model has recently been proposed as a specific form of more general null models in biogeography (the mid-domain effect) and community ecology (species co-occurrence). In both cases, the neutral model is qualitatively, but not quantitatively, similar to the predictions of classic null models. However, because the important parameters in the neutral model can rarely be measured directly, it may be of limited value as a null hypothesis for empirical tests. Future progress may come from moving beyond dichotomous tests of neutral versus null models. Instead, the neutral model might be viewed as a mechanism that contributes to pattern along with other processes. Alternatively, the fit of data to the neutral model can be compared to the fit to other process-based models that are not based on neutrality assumptions. Finally, the neutral model can also be tested directly if its parameters can be estimated independently of the test data. However, these approaches may require more data than are often available. For these reasons, simple null model tests will continue to be important in the evaluation of the neutral model. The neutral model (Bell 2000, Hubbell 2001) has generated great interest and controversy among ecolo-gists. Some of these debates echo earlier controversies in the 1980s over null model analysis (Gotelli and Graves 1996). Indeed, Enquist et al. (2002) have claimed that the neutral model is nothing more or less than a null model. Yet there remains considerable confusion about whether the neutral theory is only a null model, can function as a null model, or is different from traditional null models. In this commentary, we review the similarities and differences between null and neutral models, and point out that a failure to clearly distinguish between them has been responsible for some of the controversy surround-ing neutral models.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. The analysis of presence-absence matrices with "null model" randomization tests has been a major source of controversy in community ecology for over two decades. In this paper, I systematically compare the performance of nine null model algorithms and four co-occurrence indices with respect to Type I and Type II errors. The nine algorithms differ in whether rows and columns are treated as fixed sums, equiprobable, or proportional. The three models that maintain fixed row sums are invulnerable to Type I errors (false positives). One of these three is a modified version of the original algorithm of E. F Connor and D. Simberloff. Of the four co-occurrence indices, the number of checkerboard com-binations and the number of species combinations may be prone to Type II errors (false negatives), and may not reveal significant patterns in noisy data sets. L. Stone and A. Robert's checkerboard score has good power for detecting species pairs that do not co-occur together frequently, whereas D. Schluter's V ratio reveals nonrandom patterns in the row and column totals of the matrix. Degenerate matrices (matrices with empty rows or columns) do not greatly alter the outcome of null model analyses. The choice of an ap-propriate null model and index may depend on whether the data represent classic "island lists" of species in an archipelago or standardized "sample lists" of species collected with equal sampling effort. Systematic examination of a set of related null models can pinpoint how violation of the assumptions of the model contributes to nonrandom patterns.},

abstract = {Species richness is a fundamental measurement of community and regional diversity, and it underlies many ecological models and conservation strategies. In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category±subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to- individual ratios). Rarefaction methods ± both sample-based and individual-based ± allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

Moreover, nonrandom structure was greater in homeotherm vs. poikilotherm matrices. Although these analyses do not confirm the mechanisms of Diamond's controversial assembly rules model, they do establish that observed co-occurrence in most natural communities is usually less than expected by chance. These results contrast with previous analyses of species co-occurrence patterns and bridge the apparent gap between experimental and correlative studies in community ecology},

abstract = {This review identifies several important challenges in null model testing in ecology: 1) developing randomization algorithms that generate appropriate patterns for a specified null hypothesis; these randomization algorithms stake out a middle ground between formal Pearson–Neyman tests (which require a fully-specified null distribution) and specific process-based models (which require parameter values that cannot be easily and independently estimated); 2) developing metrics that specify a particular pattern in a matrix, but ideally exclude other, related patterns; 3) avoiding classification schemes based on idealized matrix patterns that may prove to be inconsistent or contradictory when tested with empirical matrices that do not have the idealized pattern; 4) testing the performance of proposed null models and metrics with artificial test matrices that contain specified levels of pattern and randomness; 5) moving beyond simple presence–absence matrices to incorporate species-level traits (such as abundance) and site-level traits (such as habitat suitability) into null model analysis; 6) creating null models that perform well with many sites, many species pairs, and varying degrees of spatial autocorrelation in species occurrence data. In spite of these challenges, the development and application of null models has continued to provide valuable insights in ecology, evolution, and biogeography for over 80 years.},

abstract = {Current ecological frameworks emphasize the relative importance of local and regional drivers for structuring species communities. However, most research has been carried out in systems with discrete habitat boundaries and a clear insular structure. Stream networks deviate from the insular structure and can serve as excellent model systems for studying hierarchical community dynamics over different temporal and spatial extents. We used benthic invertebrate data from streams in a small northern Swedish catchment to test whether metacommunity dynamics change between seasons, across spatial hierarchies (i.e. at the whole catchment scale vs. the scales of first-order and second/third-order sites within the catchment) and between stream-order groups. We assessed metacommunity structure as a function of three relevant dispersal dimensions (directional downstream processes, along-stream dispersal and overland dispersal). These dispersal dimensions were related to species groups with relevant dispersal traits (flying capacity, drift propensity) and dispersal capacities (weak vs. strong) to elucidate whether the observed spatial signals were due to dispersal limitation or mass effects. Results showed complex community organization that varied between seasons, with the scale of observation, and with stream order. The importance of spatial factors and specific dispersal dimensions was highly dependent on the time of sampling and the scale of observation. The importance of environmental factors was more consistent in our analyses, but their effect on species community structure peaked at first-order sites. Our analyses of species dispersal traits were not unequivocal, but indicated that both mass effects and dispersal limitation could simultaneously contribute to the spatial signal at the scale of the whole catchment through different dispersal pathways. We conclude that the study of hierarchically organized ecosystems uncovers complex patterns of metacommunity organization that may deviate substantially from those of systems with insular structure and discrete habitat boundaries. Moreover, we show that dispersal constraints imposed by the dendritic structure of stream networks and distinct dispersal mechanisms (e.g. dispersal limitation) may be evident also at very small spatial extents. Thus, even at this small scale, a landscape management approach that takes the dendritic nature of stream networks into account is needed to effectively conserve stream biodiversity.},

abstract = {The paradox of enrichment has been studied almost exclusively within communities or metacommunities, without explicit nutrient dynamics. Yet local recycling of materials from enriched ecosystems may affect the stability of connected ecosystems. Here we study the effect of nutrient, detritus, producer, and consumer spatial flows-combined with changes in regional enrichment-on the stability of a metaecosystem model. We considered both spatially homogeneous and heterogeneous enrichment. We found that nutrient and detritus spatial flows are destabilizing, whereas producer or consumer spatial flows are either neutral or stabilizing. We noticed that detritus spatial flows have only a weak impact on stability. Our study reveals that heterogeneity no longer stabilizes well-connected systems when accounting for explicit representation of nutrient dynamics. We also found that intermediate consumer diffusion could lead to multiple equilibria in strongly enriched metaecosystems. Stability can emerge from a top-down control allowing the storage of materials into inorganic form, a mechanism never documented before. In conclusion, local enrichment can be stabilized if spatial flows are strong enough to efficiently redistribute the local excess of enrichment to unfertile ecosystems. However, high regional enrichment can be dampened only by intermediate consumer diffusion rates.},

abstract = {The channel and valley-floor morphology of high-gradient streams is commonly expressed at several spatial scaels. In this paper, a taxonomy of channel and valley floor features is proposed to improve understanding of processes and landforms in steep streams and to provide a common framework for stream descriptions. This taxonomy is based on field studies in two streams drainng the western slopes of the Cascade Range in Oregon, USA. At the fines scale (10-1 to 100 channel widths), step-pool sequences formed by large boulders oriented transverse to the channel axis dominate channle structure; these features appear to form in response to flow perturbations such as antidunes during bedload transport events. An important scale from the standpoint of hydraulics and sediment transport is the channel unit scale (100 - 101 chanel widths). Pool, riffle, rapid, and cascade channel units (in order of increasing bed slope) have non-overlapping slope ranges and particles sizes, and can be distinguished in the field based on hydraulic criteria and step structure. Channel units display non-random sequence and spacing in response to both fluvial mechanims and exogenous controls, such as bedrock or source areas for large boulders along the channel margin. Formation of channel units is poorly understood but may be a steep stream analog to bar formation. Distinctive channel and valley floor morphology is also expressed at the reach scale (102 - 103 channle widths). Reach structure varies in response to the degree of constraint imposed by large-scale landslides, resistant bedrock, or alluvial fans. The ratio fo valley floor width to active channel width is an important index for distinguishing the organization of channels at this scale. Recognition of these varying scales is important for understanding longitudinal variations in sediment transport and stroage, stratifying research samp,ing, designing effective measures for erosion control, and analyzing the strucutre of biological communities.},

abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 828–839 Abstract The contribution of deterministic and stochastic processes to species coexistence is widely debated. With the introduction of powerful statistical techniques, we can now better characterise different sources of uncertainty when quantifying niche differentiation. The theoretical literature on the effect of stochasticity on coexistence, however, is often ignored by field ecologists because of its technical nature and difficulties in its application. In this review, we examine how different sources of variability in population dynamics contribute to coexistence. Unfortunately, few general rules emerge among the different models that have been studied to date. Nonetheless, we believe that a greater understanding is possible, based on the integration of coexistence and population extinction risk theories. There are two conditions for coexistence in the presence of environmental and demographic variability: (1) the average per capita growth rates of all coexisting species must be positive when at low densities, and (2) these growth rates must be strong enough to overcome negative random events potentially pushing densities to extinction. We propose that critical tests for species coexistence must account for niche differentiation arising from this variability and should be based explicitly on notions of stability and ecological drift.},

abstract = {We present a theory extending the source-sink concept with an ecosystem perspective. We analyze a model for meta-ecosystem dynamics in a heterogeneous environment to study how the spatial flows of materials such as inorganic nutrients and nutrients sequestered into producers, herbivores, and detritus affect the community dynamics. We show that spatial flows of an inorganic nutrient (direct nutrient flow) and organic matter (indirect nutrient flow) through detritus, producer, or herbivore compartments can reverse the source-sink dynamics of a local ecosystem. More precisely, the balance between such direct and indirect nutrient flows determines the net direction of nutrient flows between two ecosystems of contrasted productivities. It allows a sink to turn into a source and vice versa. This effect of nutrient flows on source and sink dynamics is robust to the ecosystem structure (with and without herbivores) and to specific ecosystem compartments contributing to nutrient flows (primary producers, herbivores, or detritus). Ecosystems in distinct localities thus interact together with the structure at one place influencing that of the other. In meta-ecosystems, the source-sink dynamics of an organism is not only constrained by its dispersal from the source to the sink, but also by the fertility and community composition in the neighborhood responsible for spatial flows of nutrients and energy. The meta-ecosystem perspective provides a powerful theoretical framework to address novel questions in spatial ecosystem ecology.},

The classic TIB does not, however, account for the complex structure of ecological systems. We extend the TIB to take into account trophic interactions and derive a species-specific model for occurrence probability. We find that the properties of the regional food web influence the species-area relationship, and that, in return, immigration and extinction dynamics affect local food web properties. We compare the accuracy of the classic TIB to our trophic TIB to predict community composition of real food webs and find strong support for our trophic extension of the TIB. Our approach provides a parsimonious explanation to species distributions and open new perspectives to integrate the complexity of ecological interactions into simple species distribution models.},

abstract = {The acidification and ongoing pH recovery of lakes in Killarney Provincial Park, Canada, provide a unique opportunity to increase our understanding of the role of dispersal as communities respond to environmental change. Time lags in community recovery following pH increases in acidified lakes have typically been attributed to local factors; however, no studies have been conducted to determine if colonist availability could also play a role. Moreover, the rates and mechanisms of dispersal to recovering lakes are poorly understood. In this study, we sought to determine if dispersal limitation could impede the recovery of zooplankton communities affected by a regional stressor. To achieve this objective, we used a combination of empirical data collection along with spatial modeling and variation partitioning techniques. Data were collected by measuring dispersal to four recovering lakes in Killarney Park. Dispersal traps were placed next to lakes to measure immigration overland, drift nets were used to measure immigration via streams, and in situ emergence traps were used to quantify immigration from historically deposited resting eggs. Documented dispersal levels were then compared with the theoretical critical density required for reproduction (N(c)) to determine if adequate numbers were dispersing to establish populations of acid-sensitive species in recovering lakes. Spatial modeling and variation partitioning were conducted using community and physical/chemical data for 45 park lakes that were collected in 1972-1973, 1990, and 2005. Field data demonstrated that a variety of zooplankton species were dispersing to recovering lakes through streams and the egg bank, but few individuals were collected dispersing overland. Although we identified 24 species of zooplankton dispersing, only six species absent from the communities of our study lakes were identified from our traps, and two of these species did not disperse in high enough numbers to surpass N(c). Local environmental variables explained the largest proportion of the variation in zooplankton communities (18-37{\%}); however, spatial variables were also important (7-18{\%}). The significant spatial patterns we found in the park's zooplankton communities, combined with the low overland dispersal levels we documented, suggest that dispersal limitation may be a more important impediment to recovery than was previously thought.},

abstract = {The biogeographic variation of life has predominantly been studied using taxonomy, but this focus is changing. There is a resurging interest in understanding patterns in the distribution not only of taxa but also of the traits those taxa possess. Patterns of trait variation shed light on fundamental questions in biology, including why organisms live where they do and how they will respond to environmental change. Technological advances such as environmental genomics place microbial ecology in a unique position to move trait-based biogeography forward. We anticipate that as trait-based biogeography continues to evolve, micro- and macroorganisms will be studied in concert, establishing a science that is informed by and relevant to all domains of life.},

abstract = {Most nutrient enrichment studies in aquatic systems have focused on autotrophic food webs in systems where primary producers dominate the resource base. We tested the heterotrophic response to long-term nutrient enrichment in a forested, headwater stream. Our study design consisted of 2 years of pretreatment data in a reference and treatment stream and 2 years of continuous nitrogen (N) + phosphorus addition to the treatment stream. Studies were conducted with two leaf species that differed in initial C:N, Rhododendron maximum (rhododendron) and Acer rubrum (red maple). We determined the effects of nutrient addition on detrital resources (leaf breakdown rates, litter C:N and microbial activity) and tested whether nutrient enrichment affected macroinvertebrate consumers via increased biomass. Leaf breakdown rates were ca. 1.5 and 3x faster during the first and second years of enrichment, respectively, in the treatment stream for both leaf types. Microbial respiration rates of both leaf types were 3x higher with enrichment, and macroinvertebrate biomass associated with leaves increased ca. 2-3x with enrichment. The mass of N in macroinvertebrate biomass relative to leaves tended to increase with enrichment up to 6x for red maple and up to 44x for rhododendron leaves. Lower quality (higher C:N) rhododendron leaves exhibited greater changes in leaf nutrient content and macroinvertebrate response to nutrient enrichment than red maple leaves, suggesting a unique response by different leaf species to nutrient enrichment. Nutrient concentrations used in this study were moderate and equivalent to those in streams draining watersheds with altered land use. Thus, our results suggest that similarly moderate levels of enrichment may affect detrital resource quality and subsequently lead to altered energy and nutrient flow in detrital food webs.},

abstract = {In bet hedging, organisms sacrifice short-term success to reduce the long-term variance in success. Delayed germination is the classic example of bet hedging, in which a fraction of seeds remain dormant as a hedge against the risk of complete reproductive failure. Here, we investigate the adaptive nature of delayed germination as a bet hedging strategy using long-term demographic data on Sonoran Desert winter annual plants. Using stochastic population models, we estimate fitness as a function of delayed germination and identify evolutionarily stable strategies for 12 abundant species in the community. Results indicate that delayed germination meets the criteria as a bet hedging strategy for all species. Density-dependent models, but not density-independent ones, predicted optimal germination strategies that correspond remarkably well with observed patterns. By incorporating naturally occurring variation in seed and seedling dynamics, our results present a rigorous test of bet hedging theory within the relevant environmental context.},

Here we use an experimental evolution approach to test the effect of the scale of competition, and how it interacts with relatedness. The cooperative trait that we examine is the production of siderophores, iron-scavenging agents, in the pathogenic bacteriumPseudomonas aeruginosa15–17 . As expected, our results show that higher levels of cooperative siderophore production evolve in the higher relatedness treat- ments. However, our results also show that more local compe- tition selects for lower levels of siderophore production and that there is a significant interaction between relatedness and the scale of competition, with relatedness having less effect when the scale of competition is more local. More generally, the scale of competition is likely to be of particular importance for the evolution of cooperation in microorganisms, and also the viru- lence of pathogenic microorganisms, because cooperative traits such as siderophore production have an important role in determining virulence6,9,17–19 .},

We used recirculating chambers to estimate surface sediment metabolism and measured deep sediment respiration in isolated sediment cores. Metabolism of the stream ecosystem was determined for a 30-m reach as dark and light oxygen change with and without black plastic sheeting that darkened the stream and prevented diffusion. Average ecosystem respiration for two dates in August (440 mg O2 m-2 h-1) exceeded respiration of either the surface sediment community (155 Mg O2 m-2 h-1) or the hyporheic community (170 mg O2 m-2 h-1) alone. Deep sediments show substantial oxygen and nitrate uptake when isolated. In the stream, this low nitrate interstitial water is exchanged with surface water. Metabolism of the isolated surface community suggests a highly productive and autotrophic system, yet gross production is balanced or exceeded by community respiration when ecosystem boundaries include the hyporheic zone. Thus, despite high rates of gross primary production (600–1200 mg O2 m-2 h-1), desert streams may be heterotrophic (PG {\textless} R) during summer.},

abstract = {Each modeller who builds and analyses an individual-based model learns of course a great deal, but what has ecology as a whole learned from the individual-based models published during the last decade? Answering this question proves extremely difficult as there is no common motivation behind individual-based models. The distinction is introduced between ‘pragmatic' motivation, which uses the individual-based approach as a tool without any reference to the theoretical issues which have emerged from the classical state variable approach and ‘paradigmatic' motivation, which explicitly refers to theoretical ecology. A mini-review of 50 individual-based animal population models shows that the majority are driven by pragmatic motivation. Most models are very complex and special techniques to cope with this complexity during their analysis are only occasionally applied. It is suggested that in order to orient individual-based modelling more towards general theoretical issues, we need increased explicit reference to theoretical ecology and an advanced strategy for building and analysing individual-based models. To this end, a heuristic list of rules is presented which may help us to advance the practice of individual-based modelling and to learn more general lessons from individual-based modelling in the future than we have during the last decade. The main ideas behind these rules are as follows: (1) Individual-based models usually make more realistic assumptions than state variable models, but it should not be forgotten that the aim of individual-based modelling is not ‘realism' but modelling. (2) The individual-based approach is a bottom-up approach which starts with the ‘parts' (i.e. individuals) of a system (i.e. population) and then tries to understand how the system's properties emerge from the interaction among these parts. However, bottom-up approaches alone will never lead to theories at the systems level. State variable or top-down approaches are needed to provide an appropriate integrated view, i.e. the relevant questions at the population level.},

abstract = {The 'ODD' (Overview, Design concepts, and Details) protocol was published in 2006 to standardize the published descriptions of individual-based and agent-based models (ABMs). The primary objectives of ODD are to make model descriptions more understandable and complete, thereby making ABMs less subject to criticism for being irreproducible. We have systematically evaluated existing uses of the ODD protocol and identified, as expected, parts of ODD needing improvement and clarification. Accordingly, we revise the definition of ODD to clarify aspects of the original version and thereby facilitate future standardization of ABM descriptions. We discuss frequently raised critiques in ODD but also two emerging, and unanticipated, benefits: ODD improves the rigorous formulation of models and helps make the theoretical foundations of large models more visible. Although the protocol was designed for ABMs, it can help with documenting any large, complex model, alleviating some general objections against such models. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Agent-based complex systems are dynamic networks of many interacting agents; examples include ecosystems, financial markets, and cities. The search for general principles underlying the internal organization of such systems often uses bottom-up simulation models such as cellular automata and agent-based models. No general framework for designing, testing, and analyzing bottom-up models has yet been established, but recent advances in ecological modeling have come together in a general strategy we call pattern-oriented modeling. This strategy provides a unifying framework for decoding the internal organization of agent-based complex systems and may lead toward unifying algorithmic theories of the relation between adaptive behavior and system complexity.},

We hypothesize that this homogenization extends to ecological struc- ture and also to ecosystem functions such as carbon dynamics and microclimate, with continental-scale impli- cations. Further, we suggest that understanding urban homogenization will provide the basis for understanding the impacts of urban land-use change from local to continental scales. Here, we show how multi-scale, multi- disciplinary datasets from six metropolitan areas that cover the major climatic regions of the US (Phoenix, AZ; Miami, FL; Baltimore, MD; Boston, MA; Minneapolis–St Paul, MN; and Los Angeles, CA) can be used to deter- mine how household and neighborhood characteristics correlate with land-management practices, land-cover composition, and landscape structure and ecosystem functions at local, regional, and continental scales.},

abstract = {Within a metacommunity, both environmental and spatial processes regulate variation in local community structure. The strength of these processes may vary depending on species traits (e.g., dispersal mode) or the characteristics of the regions studied (e.g., spatial extent, environmental heterogeneity). We studied the metacommunity structuring of three groups of stream macroinvertebrates differing in their overland dispersal mode (passive dispersers with aquatic adults; passive dispersers with terrestrial adults; active dispersers with terrestrial adults). We predicted that environmental structuring should be more important for active dispersers, because of their better ability to track environmental variability, and that spatial structuring should be more important for species with aquatic adults, because of stronger dispersal limitation. We sampled a total of 70 stream riffle sites in three drainage basins. Environmental heterogeneity was unrelated to spatial extent among our study regions, allowing us to examine the effects of these two factors on metacommunity structuring. We used partial redundancy analysis and Moran's eigenvector maps based on overland and watercourse distances to study the relative importance of environmental control and spatial structuring. We found that, compared with environmental control, spatial structuring was generally negligible, and it did not vary according to our predictions. In general, active dispersers with terrestrial adults showed stronger environmental control than the two passively dispersing groups, suggesting that the species dispersing actively are better able to track environmental variability. There were no clear differences in the results based on watercourse and overland distances. The variability in metacommunity structuring among basins was not related to the differences in the environmental heterogeneity and spatial extent. Our study emphasized that (1) environmental control is prevailing in stream metacommunities, (2) dispersal mode may have an important effect on metacommunity structuring, and (3) some factors other than spatial extent or environmental heterogeneity contributed to the differences among the basins.},

abstract = {Studies examining the relationship between species richness and the productivity of ecological communities have taken one of two opposite viewpoints, viewing either productivity as a primary driver of richness or richness as a driver of productivity. Recently, verbal and graphical hypotheses have been proposed that attempt to merge these perspectives by clarifying the causal pathways that link resource supply, species richness, resource use, and biomass production. Here we present mathematical models that formalize how these pathways can operate simultaneously in a single ecological system. Using a metacommunity framework in which classic consumer-resource competition theory governs species interactions within patches, we show that the mechanisms by which resource supply influences species richness are inherently linked to the mechanisms by which species richness controls resource use and biomass production. Unlike prior hypotheses, our models show that resource supply can affect species richness and that richness can affect productivity simultaneously at a single spatial scale. Our models also reproduce scale-dependent associations between species richness and community biomass that have been reported elsewhere. By detailing the pathways by which resource supply, species richness, biomass production, and resource use are connected, our models move closer to resolving the nature of causality in diversity-productivity relationships.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the dynamics of urban ecosystems can be enhanced by examining the multidimensional social characteristics of house- holds. To this end, we investigated the relative significance of three social theories of household structure—population, lifestyle behavior, and so- cial stratification—to the distribution of vegetation cover in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Our ability to assess the relative significance of these theories depended on fine-scale social and biophysical data. We distinguished among vegetation in three areas hypothesized to be differentially linked to these social theories: riparian areas, private lands, and public rights-of-way (PROWs). Using a mul- timodel inferential approach, we found that vari- ation of vegetation cover in riparian areas was not explained by any of the three theories and that lifestyle behavior was the best predictor of vegetation cover on private lands. Surprisingly, life- style behavior was also the best predictor of vegetation cover in PROWs. The inclusion of a quadratic term for housing age significantly im- proved the models. Based on these research re- sults, we question the exclusive use of income and education as the standard variables to explain variations in vegetation cover in urban ecological systems. We further suggest that the management of urban vegetation can be improved by devel- oping environmental marketing strategies that address the underlying household motivations for and participation in local land management.},

abstract = {Simple models representing nutrient-dependent growth of plant prey are used to study herbivores and edible and ''inedible'' plants. Three types of inedible plants are considered: those that have no direct interaction with herbivores, those that interfere with the ingestion of edible plants but are not themselves consumed, and those that are consumed but provide no nutritional benefit to herbivores. A necessary condition for coexistence at equilibrium applies for all types of inedible plants, which requires that edible plants be better competitors than inedible plants in the absence of herbivores but worse in their presence. All models predict compensatory changes in relative densities of edible and inedible plants at equilibrium as herbivore loss rate changes. If inedible plants do not interact with herbivores, then only inedible (not edible) plant biomass increases with nutrient supply; otherwise, biomasses of both edible and inedible plants increase with nutrient supply. If inedible plants interfere with ingestion of edible plants but are not consumed, then equilibria are stable in the parameter space examined, for a parameterized model of a planktonic system. In the other cases examined, equilibria are unstable in most of the parameter space examined.},

abstract = {We analyse a model food web in which two plant species compete for a nutrient and are attacked by a herbivore species, with both resource and apparent competition occurring between plants. Simple rules based on equilibrium nutrient concentration (R*) and herbivore density (H*) have been proposed to govern competitive outcomes (e.g. Holtet al., 1994,Am. Nat.144,741–771), but these earlier analyses assumed linearity of the nutrient-dependent plant growth function and the herbivore functional response. We now relax these assumptions. When plant growth is nonlinear, there is a rich set of potential trade-offs among plant competitive ability, plant maximal growth rate, plant defenses against herbivores, and preferences of herbivore attack on plants. Given stability, asymptotic outcomes can include exclusion of one plant species, priority effects wherein exclusion depends on initial conditions, and herbivore-mediated coexistence. Nonlinear herbivore functional responses potentially frustrate the application of simple rules for competitive outcomes. Nevertheless, there are circumstances in which simple rules appear to perform well. In these cases, graphical theory relates properties of food chains (nutrient, herbivore, and one plant species only) to asymptotic outcomes in food webs (with both plant species). Competitive outcomes in the graphical theory are summarized byR* andH* quantities. Our approach works best when plant species differ greatly in nutrient-dependent growth rates, and herbivores preferentially attack plants with high ratios of nutritional benefit to cost (measured by handling and processing times). A parameterized model ofDaphniaand several algal species suggests that our approach could perform well in practice.},

The presence of all understory vascular plants was recorded on 252 plots of 100 m 2 randomly se-lected within forest patches ranging in size from 0.25 ha to 218 ha. Species were divided into 6 groups, according to their ecology and conserva-tion status. Site condition was assessed at plot level and included physical attributes, human-in-duced disturbance and Quercus spp. tree cover. Landscape structure and dynamics were assessed from patch metrics and patch history. We also calculated a set of landscape metrics related to potential human accessibility to forests. Results of multiple linear regressions indicated that the variance explained for non-forest species groups was higher than for forest species richness. Most of the main correlates corresponded to site disturbance variables related to direct human alteration, or to landscape variables associated to indirect human effects on forests: Quercus tree cover (a proxy for successional status) was the most important correlate of non-forest spe-cies richness, which decreased when Quercus tree cover increased. Human-induced distur-bance was an important correlate of synan-thropic and total species richness, which were higher in recently managed and in highly fre-quented forests. Potential human accessibility also affected the richness of most species groups. In contrast, patch size, patch shape and connectivity played a minor role, as did patch history. We conclude that human influence on species richness in periurban forests takes place on a small scale, whereas large-scale effects attributable to landscape structure and frag-mentation are comparatively less important. Implications of these results for the conserva-tion of plant species in periurban forests are discussed.},

abstract = {1. We determined the effects of nutrient enrichment on wood decomposition rates and microbial activity during a 3-year study in two headwater streams at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, NC, U.S.A. After a 1-year pretreatment period, one of the streams was continuously enriched with inorganic nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) for 2 years while the other stream served as a reference. We determined the effects of enrichment on both wood veneers and sticks, which have similar carbon quality but differ in physical characteristics (e.g. surface area to volume ratios, presence of bark) that potentially affect microbial colonisation and activity. 2. Oak wood veneers (0.5 mm thick) were placed in streams monthly and allowed to decompose for approximately 90 days. Nutrient addition stimulated ash-free dry mass loss and increased mean nitrogen content, fungal biomass and microbial respiration on veneers in the treatment stream compared with the reference. The magnitude of the response to enrichment was great, with mass loss 6.1 times, and per cent N, fungal biomass and microbial respiration approximately four times greater in the treatment versus reference stream. 3. Decomposition rate and nitrogen content of maple sticks (ca. 1-2 cm diameter) also increased; however, the effect was less pronounced than for veneers. Wood response overall was greater than that determined for leaves in a comparable study, supporting the hypothesis that response to enrichment may be greater for lower quality organic matter (high C : N) than for higher quality (low C : N) substrates. 4. Our results show that moderate nutrient enrichment can profoundly affect decomposition rate and microbial activity on wood in streams. Thus, the timing and availability of wood that provides retention, structure, attachment sites and food in stream ecosystems may be affected by nutrient concentrations raised by human activities.},

abstract = {1. Large wood forms an important component of woodland river ecosystems. The relationship between large wood and the physical characteristics of river systems varies greatly with changes in the tree species of the marginal woodland, the climatic and hydrological regime, the fluvial geomorphological setting and the river and woodland management context. 2. Research on large wood and fluvial processes over the last 25 years has focussed on three main themes: the effects of wood on flow hydraulics; on the transfer of mineral and organic sediment; and on the geomorphology of river channels. 3. Analogies between wood and mineral sediment transfer processes (supply, mobility and river characteristics that affect retention) are found useful as a framework for synthesising current knowledge on large wood in rivers. 4. An important property of wood is its size when scaled to the size of the river channel. ¢Small¢ channels are defined as those whose width is less than the majority of wood pieces (e.g. width {\textless} median wood piece length). ‘Medium' channels have widths greater than the size of most wood pieces (e.g. width {\textless} upper quartile wood piece length), and ‘Large' channels are wider than the length of all of the wood pieces delivered to them. 5. A conceptual framework defined here for evaluating the storage and dynamics of wood in rivers ranks the relative importance of hydrological characteristics (flow regime, sediment transport regime), wood characteristics (piece size, buoyancy, morphological complexity) and geomorphological characteristics (channel width, geomorphological style) in ‘Small', ‘Medium' and ‘Large' rivers. 6. Wood pieces are large in comparison with river size in ‘small' rivers, therefore they tend to remain close to where they are delivered to the river and provide important structures in the stream, controlling rather than responding to the hydrological and sediment transfer characteristics of the river. 7. For ‘Medium' rivers, the combination of wood length and form becomes critical to the stability of wood within the channel. Wood accumulations form as a result of smaller or more mobile wood pieces accumulating behind key pieces. Wood transport is governed mainly by the flow regime and the buoyancy of the wood. Even quite large wood pieces may require partial burial to give them stability, so enhancing the importance of the sediment transport regime. 8. Wood dynamics in ‘Large' rivers vary with the geometry of the channel (slope and channel pattern), which controls the delivery, mobility and breakage of wood, and also the characteristics of the riparian zone, from where the greatest volume of wood is introduced. Wood retention depends on the channel pattern and the distribution of flow velocity. A large amount is stored at the channel margins. The greater the contact between the active channel and the forested floodplain and islands, the greater the quantity of wood that is stored.},

Over four consecutive 4-month periods, deposited propagules (predominantly seeds) and sediment were sampled at 78 river bed, bank face and bank top sites within three river reaches in two catchments. Species of deposited propagules were compared with the propagule bank and standing vegetation to identify {\^{a}}€˜new{\^{a}}€™ species. 3. Forty-four percent of deposited propagule species were not present in the vegetation and the largest proportions were deposited in winter. New propagules showed a higher proportion of species that establish long-term seed banks and produce light seeds, a higher proportion of R-strategists, and a lower proportion of C-strategists than species in the vegetation. 4. Ordination of propagule species abundance data revealed differences in samples between reaches; bed and bank locations; and sampling periods. Within depositional samples there were significant positive correlations between average C scores and the proportion of species producing relatively heavy, short-lived seeds and scores on an ordination axis describing a gradient from channel bed to bank top. 5. Correlations and multiple regression models between species richness and abundance of deposited propagules (total and new), and the quantity and calibre of river-deposited sediment, demonstrated a direct link between propagule deposition and hydraulic conditions during inundation. 6. Synthesis. Riparian connectivity of river flows, varying hydraulic conditions and temporary storage of propagules are all complex components of hydrochorous propagule dispersal in the study reaches. Flood flows can transfer sediment particles and non-buoyant, viable propagules from the river into the riparian zone. Propagules can pass in and out of storage within the channel bed and margins through a variety of dispersal processes and can then settle out of the water in suitable depositional environments generating distinct spatial and temporal patterns in total propagule deposition. New propagules show greatest floristic similarity to propagule bank and bed samples. They are preferentially smaller, lighter and form longer term seed banks, making them particularly suitable for long distance transport over prolonged time periods and for widespread dispersal across river margins.

abstract = {This paper combines previously developed models for nonlinear age-dependent population dynamics with the classical Volterra-Lotka model of interacting predator and prey populations. For the resulting models the basic evolution equations of the theory reduce to systems of ordinary differential equations. The limiting dynamics of the predator and prey populations are shown to depend substantially on what ages of prey are eaten by predators. Two cases in particular are studied: where the predator eats all ages of prey incidscriminately, and where the predator eats only eggs (or newborns, equivalently). Indiscriminate eating is found to lead to stable periodic oscillations in numbers of predator and prey, such as occur in the Volterra-Lotka equations while egg eating leads to oscillations which increase reapidly in amplitude and results, ultimately, in the extinction of both predator and prey. It is suggested that age-selective predation could be a more effective means of extinction than age-indiscriminate predation.},

abstract = {One of the central questions of metacommunity theory is how dispersal of organisms affects species diversity. Here, we show that the diversity-dispersal relationship should not be studied in isolation of other abiotic and biotic flows in the metacommunity. We study a mechanistic metacommunity model in which consumer species compete for an abiotic or biotic resource. We consider both consumer species specialised to a habitat patch, and generalist species capable of using the resource throughout the metacommunity. We present analytical results for different limiting values of consumer dispersal and resource dispersal, and complement these results with simulations for intermediate dispersal values. Our analysis reveals generic patterns for the combined effects of consumer and resource dispersal on the metacommunity diversity of consumer species, and shows that hump-shaped relationships between local diversity and dispersal are not universal. Diversity-dispersal relationships can also be monotonically increasing or multimodal. Our work is a new step towards a general theory of metacommunity diversity integrating dispersal at multiple trophic levels.},

abstract = {Recent studies have documented rates of evolution of ecologically important phenotypes sufficiently fast that they have the potential to impact the outcome of ecological interactions while they are underway. Observations of this type go against accepted wisdom that ecological and evolutionary dynamics occur at very different time scales. While some authors have evaluated the rapidity of a measured evolutionary rate by comparing it to the overall distribution of measured evolutionary rates, we believe that ecologists are mainly interested in rapid evolution because of its potential to impinge on ecological processes. We therefore propose that rapid evolution be defined as a genetic change occurring rapidly enough to have a measurable impact on simultaneous ecological change. Using this definition we propose a framework for decomposing rates of ecological change into components driven by simultaneous evolutionary change and by change in a non-evolutionary factor (e.g. density dependent population dynamics, abiotic environmental change). Evolution is judged to be rapid in this ecological context if its contribution to ecological change is large relative to the contribution of other factors. We provide a worked example of this approach based on a theoretical predator-prey interaction [Abrams, P. {\&} Matsuda, H. (1997). Evolution, 51, 1740], and find that in this system the impact of prey evolution on predator per capita growth rate is 63{\%} that of internal ecological dynamics. We then propose analytical methods for measuring these contributions in field situations, and apply them to two long-term data sets for which suitable ecological and evolutionary data exist. For both data sets relatively high rates of evolutionary change have been found when measured as character change in standard deviations per generation (haldanes). For Darwin's finches evolving in response to fluctuating rainfall [Grant, P.R. {\&} Grant, B.R. (2002). Science, 296, 707], we estimate that evolutionary change has been more rapid than ecological change by a factor of 2.2. For a population of freshwater copepods whose life history evolves in response to fluctuating fish predation [Hairston, N.G. Jr {\&} Dillon, T.A. (1990). Evolution, 44, 1796], we find that evolutionary change has been about one quarter the rate of ecological change - less than in the finch example, but nevertheless substantial. These analyses support the view that in order to understand temporal dynamics in ecological processes it is critical to consider the extent to which the attributes of the system under investigation are simultaneously changing as a result of rapid evolution.

@article{Hairston1993,
abstract = {Measurements of the efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels are consistent with the hypothesis that it is trophic structure that controls the fraction of energy consumed at each trophic level, rather than energetics controlling trophic structure. Moreover, trophic structure is determined by competitive and predator-prey interactions. In freshwater pelagic communities, the collective efficiency of herbivorous plankton in consuming primary producers is up to 10 times as great as is the efficiency of forest herbivores in consuming their food. Conversely, forest predators are about three times as efficient in consuming herbivore production as are zooplanktivorous fish. The presence of an additional level, piscivorous fish, in pelagic communities accounts for the difference. In the aquatic system, herbivorous zooplankton are freed from predation by the effect of piscivorous fish on their predators; in the terrestrial system, green plants are freed from herbivory by predation on the herbivores. We explain the contrast between freshwater pelagic systems and forests and prairies as follows: Pelagic ecosystems have more trophic levels as a result of selection for small rapidly growing primary producers, which cannot hold space in the fluid medium, in contrast to large space-occupying producers in the terrestrial environment. Consumers in pelagic systems are more frequently gape limited in the size range of food they can ingest than are grasping consumers in terrestrial systems. This difference makes for two largely distinct levels of predators in pelagic communities. The energy within the living, nondetrital components is more finely divided between trophic levels in pelagic systems than in terrestrial systems. Ecological efficiencies do not determine trophic structure; rather, they are its product.},

abstract = {Skistodiaptomus oregonensis and Leptodiaptomus minutus produce diapausing eggs in a large lake, Oneida Lake, in New York State. The timing of the switch from production of subitaneous (immediately hatching) eggs to diapausing eggs for both species is in October. This timing is consistent with a pattern, reviewed here, for other populations of diaptomid copepods: populations living in large lakes tend to begin production of diapausing eggs later in the season than those living in small lakes. Populations living in temporary ponds tend to switch still earlier in the season. All populations reviewed here live in the north temperate zone. The sediments of Oneida Lake contain densities of diaptomid diapausing eggs on the order of 10(5) m-2 per cm below the sediment surface down to 5 cm. Below this sediment depth, egg densities decline. The highest egg densities werefound in sediments under the deepest water. Diapausing eggs of L. minutus survive in the sediments at least two years, as shown by the recovery of the population after a year in which no new diapausing eggs were produced, and probably for two or more decades. Long-term dormancy can have the effect of ensuring the continuation of a population through periods of poor recruitment, and can help create conditions for the coexistence of competing species. Other investigators have suggested that S. oregonensis and L. minutus are competitors in other lakes when they co-occur.},

abstract = {Although more consensus is now emerging on the magnitude and frequency of cascading trophic effects in aquatic communities, the debate over their terrestrial counterparts continues. We used meta-analysis to analyze field experiments on trophic cascades in terrestrial arthropod-dominated food webs to evaluate the overall magnitude of trophic cascades and conditions affecting their occurrence and strength. We found extensive support for the presence of trophic cascades in terrestrial communities. In the majority of experiments, predator removal led to increased densities of herbivorous insects and higher levels of plant damage. Cascades in which removing predators led to decreased herbivory also were detected but were less frequent and weaker, suggesting a predominantly three-trophic-level behavior of arthropod-dominated terrestrial food webs. Despite the clear evidence that cascades often decreased plant damage, residual effects of predation produced either no or only minimal changes in overall plant biomass. Agricultural systems and natural communities exhibited similarly strong effects of predation on herbivore abundance. However, resulting effects on plant damage and community-wide effects of trophic cascades on plant biomass usually were highly variable, and only in the managed agricultural systems did predators occasionally have strong indirect effects on plant biomass. Our meta-analysis suggests that the effects of trophic cascades on the biomass of primary producers are weaker in terrestrial than aquatic food webs.},

abstract = {Currently, one of the biggest challenges in micro- bial and ecosystem ecology is to develop conceptual models that organize the growing body of infor- mation on environmental microbiology into a clear mechanistic framework with a direct link to eco- system processes. Doing so will enable develop- ment of testable hypotheses to better direct future research and increase understanding of key con- straints on biogeochemical networks. Although the understanding of phenotypic and genotypic diver- sity of microorganisms in the environment is rap- idly accumulating, how controls on microbial physiology ultimately affect biogeochemical fluxes remains poorly understood. We propose that in- sight into constraints on biogeochemical cycles can be achieved by a more rigorous evaluation of microbial community biomass composition within the context of ecological stoichiometry. Multiple recent studies have pointed to microbial biomass stoichiometry as an important determinant of when microorganisms retain or recycle mineral nutrients. We identify the relevant cellular com- ponents that most likely drive changes in microbial biomass stoichiometry by defining a conceptual model rooted in ecological stoichiometry. More importantly, we show how X-ray microanalysis (XRMA), nanoscale secondary ion mass spectros- copy (NanoSIMS), Raman microspectroscopy, and in situ hybridization techniques (for example, FISH) can be applied in concert to allow for direct empirical evaluation of the proposed conceptual framework. This approach links an important piece of the ecological literature, ecological stoichiome- try, with the molecular front of the microbial rev- olution, in an attempt to provide new insight into how microbial physiology could constrain ecosys- tem processes.},

abstract = {1. Shifts in bacterial community composition along temporal and spatial temperature gradients occur in a wide range of habitats and have potentially important implications for ecosystem functioning. However, it is often challenging to empirically link an adaptation or acclimation that defines environmental niche or biogeography with a quantifiable phenotype, especially in micro-organisms. 2. Here we evaluate a possible mechanistic explanation for shifts in bacterioplankton community composition in response to temperature by testing a previously hypothesized membrane mediated trade-off between resource acquisition and respiratory costs. 3. We isolated two strains of Flavobacterium sp. at two temperatures (cold isolate and warm isolate) from the epilimnion of a small temperate lake in North Central Minnesota. 4. Compared with the cold isolate the warm isolate had higher growth rate, higher carrying capacity, lower lag time and lower respiration at the high temperature and lower phosphorus uptake at the low temperature. We also observed significant differences in membrane lipid composition between isolates and between environments that were consistent with adjustments necessary to maintain membrane fluidity at different temperatures. 5. Our results suggest that temperature acclimation in planktonic bacteria is, in part, a resource-dependent membrane-facilitated phenomenon. This study provides an explicit example of how a quantifiable phenotype can be linked through physiology to competitive ability and environmental niche.},

To examine this relationship, we injected a conservative tracer and nutrients (ammonium and phosphate) into 13 streams for a total of 37 injections at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), New Hampshire. Transient storage was estimated by fitting conservative solute data to a one-dimensional advection, dispersion, transient storage model. To correct for variation in depth and velocity among streams, we considered nutrient uptake as a mass- transfer coefficient (Vf), which estimates benthic demand for nutrients relative to supply. Transient storage decreased with increasing specific discharge (discharge per unit stream width). Transient storage explained only 14{\%} of variation in ammonium Vf during the entire year and 35{\%} of variation during summer months. Phosphate uptake was not related to transient storage, presumably because P uptake is predominantly by chemical sorption at HBEE At HBEF, surface water pools can store water but were not modeled as such by use of the transient storage model. These pools were probably not important areas of nutrient uptake; further variation in the relationship between nutrient uptake and transient storage may be explained by biological demand},

abstract = {Ecological stoichiometry and food web theories focus on distinct mechanisms that shape communities. These mechanisms, however, likely interact in ways that neither theory alone addresses. To illustrate, we show how a model that tracks flow of energy and nutrients through two producers and two grazers reveals two indirect, interrelated roles for "neutrally inedible" producers. First, inedible producers can exert controls over the nutrient content of edible producers and indirectly influence whether grazers are nutrient or energy limited. Second, through these controls, inedible producers can shape community assembly by excluding grazers that are weak competitors for nutrients contained in edible producers. A mesocosm experiment revealed patterns consistent with both predictions: high abundances of inedible algae were accompanied by low phosphorus contents of edible algae and low abundances of the grazer Daphnia. Both lines of inference suggest that interactions between stoichiometry and plant heterogeneity may shape plankton communities.},

abstract = {A stoichiometrically explicit approach to food web ecology yields new insight into promotion and degradation of diversity, changes in species composition along environmental gradients, biomass partitioning among trophic levels, and limitation of primary production. These revelations emerge from food web modules that incorporate fundamental constraints imposed by mass balance and a key trait, stoichiometric body composition, into a species' niche. These niche components involve a species' requirements from its environment and its own impacts on its environment. More specifically, stoichiometric composition influences minimal nutrient requirements of consumers (perhaps especially grazers); this component becomes pertinent because large imbalances often arise between nutrient:carbon content of consumers relative to prey. Furthermore, these imbalances then modulate the impact of consumers on their own resources through nutrient recycling. Once these niche components become synthesized, their implications in shaping food webs provide powerful mechanisms linking changes in environmental gradients with community structure and ecosystem function.

Ecological stoichiometry has recently provided a new potential mechanism linking resource (light and nutrient) supply gradients to grazer performance via elemental food-quality mechanisms. More specifically, it predicts that light and nutrient gradients should determine the relative dominance of P-rich taxa, such as Daphnia, in grazer assemblages. We tested this hypothesis in pond mesocosms (cattle tanks) by creating gradients of resource supply and predation risk, to which we added diverse assemblages of algal producer and zooplankton grazer species. We then characterized the end-point composition of grazer assemblages and quantity and elemental food quality of edible algae. We found that somatically P-rich Daphnia only dominated grazer assemblages in high-nutrient, no-predator treatments. In these ecosystems, P sequestered in producers exceeded a critical concentration.

abstract = {The stoichiometric light:nutrient hypothesis (LNH) links the relative supplies of key resources with the nutrient content of tissues of producers. This resource-driven variation in producer stoichiometry, in turn, can mediate the efficiency of grazing. Typically, discussions of the LNH attribute this resource-stoichiometry link to bottom-up effects of light and phosphorus, which are mediated through producer physiology. Emphasis on bottom-up effects implies that grazers must consume food of quality solely determined by resource supply to ecosystems (i.e., they eat what they are served). Here, we expand upon this largely bottom-up interpretation with evidence from pond surveys, a mesocosm experiment, and a model. Data from shallow ponds showed the "LNH pattern" (positive correlation of an index of light : phosphorus supply with algal carbon : phosphorus content). However, algal carbon : phosphorus content also declined as zooplankton biomass increased in the ponds. The experiment and model confirmed that this latter correlation was partially caused by the various bottom-up and top-down roles of grazers: the LNH pattern emerged only in treatments with crustacean grazers, not those without them. Furthermore, model and experiment clarified that another bottom-up factor, natural covariation of nitrogen : phosphorus ratios with light : phosphorus supply (as seen in ponds), does not likely contribute to the LNH pattern. Finally, the experiment produced correlations between shifts in species composition of algae, partially driven by grazing effects of crustaceans, and algal stoichiometry. These shifts in species composition might shape stoichiometric response of producer assemblages to resource supply and grazing, but their consequences remain largely unexplored. Thus, this study accentuated the importance of grazing for the LNH; de-emphasized a potentially confounding, bottom-up factor (covarying nitrogen : phosphorus supply); and highlighted an avenue for future research for the LNH (grazer-mediated shifts in producer composition).},

Unlike prior laboratory studies, the N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton in Michigan ponds clustered around and below the Redfield ratio (7.2:1 by mass), despite wide variation in N:P supply ratios (2:1–63:1 by mass) and the presence of grazers. In a mesocosm experiment, the N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton cells again deviated from a nearly 1:1 relationship with N:P supply.

Groundwater ecology has evolved from a science describing the unique subterranean biota to its current form emphasising multidisciplinary studies that integrate hydrogeology and ecology. This multidisciplinary approach seeks to elucidate the function of groundwater ecosystems and their roles in maintaining subterranean and surface water quality. In aquifer-surface water ecotones, geochemical gradients and microbial biofilms mediate transformations of water chemistry. Subsurface fauna (stygofauna) graze biofilms, alter interstitial pore size through their movement, and physically transport material through the groundwater environment. Further, changes in their populations provide signals of declining water quality. Better integrating groundwater ecology, biogeochemistry, and hydrogeology will significantly advance our understanding of subterranean ecosystems, especially in terms of bioremediation of contaminated groundwaters, maintenance or improvement of surface water quality in groundwater-dependent ecosystems, and improved protection of groundwater habitats during the extraction of natural resources. Overall, this will lead to a better understanding of the implications of groundwater hydrology and aquifer geology to distributions of subsurface fauna and microbiota, ecological processes such as carbon cycling, and sustainable groundwater management.

abstract = {Metagenomics (also referred to as environmental and community genomics) is the genomic analysis of microorganisms by direct extraction and cloning of DNA from an assemblage of microorganisms. The development of metagenomics stemmed from the ineluctable evidence that as-yet-uncultured microorganisms represent the vast majority of organisms in most environments on earth. This evidence was derived from analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified directly from the environment, an approach that avoided the bias imposed by culturing and led to the discovery of vast new lineages of microbial life. Although the portrait of the microbial world was revolutionized by analysis of 16S rRNA genes, such studies yielded only a phylogenetic description of community membership, providing little insight into the genetics, physiology, and biochemistry of the members. Metagenomics provides a second tier of technical innovation that facilitates study of the physiology and ecology of environmental microorganisms. Novel genes and gene products discovered through metagenomics include the first bacteriorhodopsin of bacterial origin; novel small molecules with antimicrobial activity; and new members of families of known proteins, such as an Na(+)(Li(+))/H(+) antiporter, RecA, DNA polymerase, and antibiotic resistance determinants. Reassembly of multiple genomes has provided insight into energy and nutrient cycling within the community, genome structure, gene function, population genetics and microheterogeneity, and lateral gene transfer among members of an uncultured community. The application of metagenomic sequence information will facilitate the design of better culturing strategies to link genomic analysis with pure culture studies.},

Well established effects of habitat patch area and Isolation on migration, colonization and population extinction have now become integrated with classic metapopulation dynamics.

abstract = {The worldwide loss and fragmentation of natural habitats-1 has led to considerable theory on metapopulation dynamics-2-8. One modelling approach, using structured population models-9,10, predicts that metapopulations in which local dynamics are affected by migration may have alternative stable equilibria-11-17. We have tested this prediction with extensive data on the butterfly Melitaea cinxia-18,19. Here we show that the probability of local extinction decreases with increasing population size and increasing immigration rate, and that local populations tend to be larger in regions with higher density of extant populations-19, results consistent with model assumptions and predictions-13,17. Our results exhibit a bifurcation pattern indicating multiple equilibria-14, with a strikingly bimodal distribution of the fraction of occupied habitat in 65 semiindependent patch networks. These results help to explain observations of species occupying either most, or very little, of the suitable habitat in well-connected patch networks-14,20,21. Metapopulations with multiple equilibria may collapse unexpectedly to extinction even in landscapes degrading only slowly. Multiple equilibria make it difficult to predict the occurrence of species in fragmented landscapes.},

abstract = {Recently, microbiologists have established the existence of biogeographic patterns among a wide range of microorganisms. The focus of the field is now shifting to identifying the mechanisms that shape these patterns. Here, we propose that four processes - selection, drift, dispersal and mutation - create and maintain microbial biogeographic patterns on inseparable ecological and evolutionary scales. We consider how the interplay of these processes affects one biogeographic pattern, the distance-decay relationship, and review evidence from the published literature for the processes driving this pattern in microorganisms. Given the limitations of inferring processes from biogeographic patterns, we suggest that studies should focus on directly testing the underlying processes.},

Whole watershed land use in the 1950s was the best predictor of present-day diversity, whereas riparian land use and watershed land use in the 1990s were comparatively poor indicators. Our findings indicate that past land-use activity, particularly agriculture, may result in long-term modifications to and reductions in aquatic diversity, regardless of reforestation of riparian zones. Preservation of habitat fragments may not be sufficient to maintain natural diversity in streams, and maintenance of such biodiversity may require conservation of much or all of the watershed.},

We show that the fossil, phylogenetic, and morphological evidence that has been used to suggest that ecological processes set limits to diversity in evolutionary time is weak and inconsistent. At the same time, ecological evidence from biological invasions, experiments, and diversity analyses strongly supports the openness of communities to new species. We urge evolutionary biologists to recognize that ecology has largely moved beyond simple notions of equilibrium at a carrying capacity and toward a richer view of communities as highly dynamic in space and time.},

abstract = {Hydrometeorological data for two watersheds in western Oregon indicate snowmelt during rainfall has been a dominant hydrologic process which is responsible for erosion within headwater areas and for downstream flooding. The majority of the larger peak flows in both watersheds result from snowmelt during rainfall. In a stream draining a 60-ha watershed in the zone of transient shallow snowpacks, a major peak flow of 10 l/s per ha is five times more likely to result from rain-on-snow than from rain alone. In a 62.4-km2 watershed, largely within the transient snowpack zone, 85{\%} of all landslides which could be accurately dated were associated with snowmelt during rainfall. By increasing melt caused by condensation and convective heat transfer, clearcut logging, especially on southwestern-facing slopes, may be increasing water input to soil up to 25{\%} during infrequent combinations of shallow snowpacks, heavy rains, relatively warm air and wind. Under more frequent combinations, increases in water input still could be 10{\%}. Limitations in present knowledge are discussed. ?? 1981.},

The study area consists of three small watersheds located between the 865 and 1155 meter elevations on the south aspect of Blue Ridge, the major divide between the Blue River drainage to the north and the Lookout Creek watershed which comprises the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest. Timber harvest in watersheds containing 130 year old timber increased annual water yield up to 42 cm. For 4 years after logging, yield increases averaged 38 cm at a 13.0 ha clearcut watershed and 20 cm at a 15.4 ha watershed where timber was shelterwood cut. Increased summer flows were indicated by the much smaller number of low-flow days after logging, particularly at the clearcut watershed. During the 1977 drought year, only eight and two low-flow days occurred at the clearcut and shelterwood cut watersheds, respectively, compared to 143 and 135 low-flow days predicted by the calibration relationship. Neither the size nor the timing of peak flows changed significantly after logging at either watershed. (Baker-FRC)},

abstract = {Metacommunity models predict that communities in patchy environments will show different patterns of diversity than communities in continuous habitats. The species richness of herbs was measured in 24 small patches (0.5-3 ha) of serpentine soil and 24 equivalently spaced sets of sampling sites on four large areas ({\textgreater}5 km(2)) of serpentine soil in the North Coast Ranges of California. Patchy and continuous sites were compared with respect to local diversity (species richness within 5 x 50 m transects), regional diversity (species richness at all 24 sites combined), and among-site differentiation (average proportion of species unshared between any one site and the other 23 sites of its kind). For all herb species together, regional diversity and average local diversity were higher on small patches, mainly because of a significantly higher number of alien species. For the subset (14{\%}) of herb species that were endemic to serpentine, regional diversity was similar on patchy and continuous sites, but it was partitioned differently; local diversity was lower and among-site differentiation was higher on small patches. Herb diversity also showed significant gradients with soil calcium levels, and these effects were not independent of site type (patchy or continuous). Soil calcium was correlated positively with the number of alien species on small patches, and negatively with the number of serpentine-endemic species on continuous sites. Also, total herb diversity was negatively correlated with elevation on continuous sites. However, patchy and continuous sites did not differ in their average calcium levels or elevation. These results agree with theory predicting that, relative to communities in widespread habitats, local communities in patchy habitats will contain more habitat generalist and fewer habitat specialist species. However, the results also suggest that the effects of habitat geometry interact with those of habitat quality in this system.},

abstract = {Competitive coexistence in a spatially heterogeneous environment is traditionally attributed to niche differences, but several recent theories have proposed important additional roles for propagule limitation and chance (e.g., neutral theory, stochastic niche theory, spatial storage effect). We tested whether propagule supply and timing of disturbance affected the coexistence of three ecologically similar plants that replace one another with partial overlap along a local soil gradient. We asked what prevents the species that dominates the most common habitat (Holocarpha virgata, open hillsides) from invading the habitats where the other two species are dominant (Calycadenia pauciflora, rocky hilltops; Hemizonia congesta, clay-rich bottomlands). We added abundant Holocarpha seeds into Calycadenia and Hemizonia habitats that were experimentally disturbed at different times of year. Initial Holocarpha seedling densities in Calycadenia and Hemizonia habitats equaled or exceeded those in unmanipulated Holocarpha habitat, but Holocarpha survival, adult size, and fecundity were much lower outside its own habitat. Holocarpha persisted in Calycadenia and Hemizonia habitats for three years, and springtime disturbance promoted this expansion. However, outside its own habitat Holocarpha showed below-replacement fitness and little competitive effect on the other two species. Our results were most consistent with a deterministic view of spatial niches. Nonetheless, chance events may often cause natural communities to include some transient populations at any given time, leading them to appear "unsaturated" with species.},

abstract = {Flowing water has profound effects on a diverse array of ecological processes and patterns in streams and rivers. We propose a conceptual framework for investigating the multiple causal pathways by which flow influences benthic biota and focus particular attention on the local scales at which these organisms respond to flow. Flow (especially characteristics linked to the velocity field) can strongly affect habitat characteristics, dispersal, resource acquisition, competition, and predation; creative experiments will be needed to disentangle these complex interactions. Benthic organisms usually reside within the roughness layer, where the unique arrangement of sediment particles produces strongly sheared and highly three-dimensional flow patterns. Thus, accurate characterization of the local flow environments experienced by benthic organisms often requires the use of flow measurement technology with high spatial and temporal resolution. Because flow exhibits variation across a broad range of scales, it is also necessary to examine how organism-flow relationships at one scale are linked to those at others. Interdisciplinary approaches are needed in the study of physical-biological coupling; increased collaboration between ecologists and experts in fluid mechanics and hydraulic engineering is particularly desirable. A greater understanding of physical-biological coupling will not only yield deeper insights into the ecological organization of streams and rivers, it will also improve our ability to predict how flow alterations caused by various human activities affect these vital ecosystems.},

abstract = {The biodiversity scaling metrics widely studied in macroecology include the species–area relationship (SAR), the scale-dependent species–abundance distribution (SAD),the distribution of masses or metabolic energies of individuals within and across species, theabundance–energy or abundance–mass relationship across species, and the species-level occupancy distributions across space. We propose a theoretical framework for predicting thescaling forms of these and other metrics based on the state-variable concept and an analyticalmethod derived from information theory. In statistical physics, a method of inference based oninformation entropy results in a complete macro-scale description of classical thermodynamicsystems in terms of the state variables volume, temperature, and number of molecules. In analogy, we take the state variables of an ecosystem to be its total area, the total number ofspecies within any specified taxonomic group in that area, the total number of individualsacross those species, and the summed metabolic energy rate for all those individuals. In termssolely of ratios of those state variables, and without invoking any specific ecologicalmechanisms, we show that realistic functional forms for the macroecological metrics listedabove are inferred based on information entropy. The Fisher log series SAD emerges naturallyfrom the theory. The SAR is predicted to have negative curvature on a log–log plot, but as theratio of the number of species to the number of individuals decreases, the SAR becomes betterand better approximated by a power law, with the predicted slope z in the range of 0.14–0.20.Using the 3/4 power mass–metabolism scaling relation to relate energy requirements and measured body sizes, the Damuth scaling rule relating mass and abundance is also predictedby the theory. We argue that the predicted forms of the macroecological metrics are inreasonable agreement with the patterns observed from plant census data across habitats andspatial scales. While this is encouraging, given the absence of adjustable fitting parameters inthe theory, we further argue that even small discrepancies between data and predictions canhelp identify ecological mechanisms that influence macroecological patterns.},

abstract = {A theory of spatial structure in ecological communities is presented and tested. At the core of the theory is a simple allocation rule for the assembly of species in space. The theory leads, with no adjustable parameters, to nonrandorn statistical predictions for the spatial distribution of species at multiple spatial scales. The distributions are such that the abundance of a species at the largest measured scale uniquely determines the spatial-abundance distribution of the individuals of that species at smaller spatial scales. The shape of the species-area relationship, the endemics-area relationship, a scale-dependent community-level spatial-abundance distribution, the species-abundance distribution at small spatial scales, an index of intraspecific aggregation, the range-area relationship, and the dependence of species turnover on interpatch distance and on patch size are also uniquely predicted as a function solely of the list of abundances of the species at the largest spatial scale. We show that the spatial structure of three spatially explicit vegetation census data sets (i.e., a 64-m(2) serpentine grassland plot, a 50-ha moist. tropical forest plot, and a 9.68-ha dry tropical forest plot) are generally consistent with the predictions of the theory, despite the very simple statistical assumption upon which the theory is based, and the absence of adjustable parameters. However, deviations between predicted and observed distributions do arise for the species with the highest abundances; the pattern of those deviations indicates that the theory, which currently contains no explicit description of interaction mechanisms among individuals within species, could be improved with the incorporation of intraspecific density dependence.},

abstract = {IN a patchy environment, dispersal between neighbouring local populations can allow the total (regional) population to persist1–5; even where all patches are identical and the within-patch dynamics are unstable, the total population readily persists as a metapopulation. This persistence is associated with striking, self-organized spatial patterns in the densities of the subpopulations. In the case of hosts and parasitoids, these may form spiral waves, spatial chaos, or a so-called 'crystal lattice' with regularly spaced knots of high population density4,6. Here we extend earlier work on two species to three or more, showing that coexistence of competing species is usually associated with some degree of persistent spatial segregation, even when the environment is uniform. At its most extreme, this can confine one species to small, relatively static 'islands' within the habitat, giving the appearance of isolated pockets of favourable habitat. The distributions of interacting species may thus result from a trade-off between dispersal and competition within subpopulations, as much as from external factors.},

abstract = {View larger version (186K) Alan Hastings, MacArthur Award Recipient, 2006 Explicit consideration of timescales and dynamics is required for an understanding of fundamental issues in ecology. Endogenous dynamics can lead to transient states where asymptotic behavior is very different from dynamics on short timescales. The causes of these kinds of transients can be placed in one of three classes: linear systems with different timescales embedded or exhibiting reactive behavior, the potentially long times to reach synchrony across space for oscillating systems, and the complex dynamics of systems with strong density-dependent (nonlinear) interactions. It is also important to include the potentially disparate timescales inherent in ecological systems when determining the endogenous dynamics. I argue that the dynamics of ecological systems can best be understood as the response, which may include transient dynamics, to exogenous influences leading to the observed dynamics on ecologically relevant timescales. This view of ecosystem behavior as responses of ecological systems governed by endogenous dynamics to exogenous influences provides a synthetic way to unify different approaches to population dynamics, to understand mechanisms that determine the distribution and abundance of species, and to manage ecosystems on appropriate timescales. There are implications for theoretical approaches, empirical approaches, and the statistical approaches that bridge theory and observation.},

For a general model incorporating the role of succession or patch age-dependent extinction, I show that persistence requires the per-patch colonization rate to be greater than the inverse of mean patch age, where age is the time since the patch became available for colonization. Because mean patch age can be arbitrarily large relative to the extinction rate, currently persisting metapopulations may be persisting despite small colonization rates, and management approaches that do not consider the role of mean patch age may unnecessarily doom populations to extinction.},

Very simple models incorporating the key features of temporally varying resources and specific descriptions of survivorship for consumer species show the overriding importance of the time dependence of available resources and the role that allochthonous inputs play as essentially insurance in allowing species to persist. Persistence of species with lifetimes short relative to the timescale of resource variability is determined by the geometric mean of resource levels, while the persistence of species where resources vary on a much shorter time scale (or with exponential survivorship) are determined by the arithmetic mean of resource levels. Models that incorporate features of time-varying resources and explicit life histories dramatically change our understanding of how fluctuations in resource availability through time and space will affect population persistence and community dynamics.},

abstract = {A study of one of the simplest systems incorporating both dispersal and local dynamics, coupling two discrete time logistic equations, demonstrates several surprising features. Passive dispersal can cause chaotic dynamics to be replaced by simple periodic dynamics. Thus passive movement can be stabilizing, even in a deterministic model without underlying spatial variation in the dynamics. The boundary between initial conditions leading to qualitatively different dynamics can be a fractal, so it is essentially impossible to specify the asymptotic behavior in terms of the initial conditions. In accord with several recent studies of arthropods and earlier theoretical work, density dependence may only be detectable at a small enough spatial scale, so efforts to uncover density dependence must include investigations of movement.},

We show that persistence of such a population of connected subpopulations depends on whether the sum of the reproductive gains through all possible closed, between-patch reproductive paths through multiple generations, relative to the shortfall in self-persistence in each path, exceeds unity plus extra terms, which only appear if there are four or more patches. These extra terms have the heuristic explanation that they avoid double counting of reproductive paths that arise with four or more patches because there can be nonoverlapping subnetworks. Thus only those patterns of reproduction and connectivity which eventually lead to descendants returning to the patch from which they originate contribute to persistence. This result provides the basis for evaluating connectivity and habitat heterogeneity to understand reserve design, the effects of human fragmentation, the collapse of marine fisheries, and other conservation issues.},

For a population classified only by age, and not stage or size, a simpler biologically interpretable condition can be used, namely whether R0, the mean number of offspring per newborn, is greater than one. However, for the many populations not easily described using only age classes, stage-structured models must be used for which there is currently no quantity like R0. We determine analogous quantities that must be greater than one for persistence of a general structured population model that have a similar useful biological interpretation. Our approach can be used immediately to determine the magnitude of changes and interactions that would either allow population persistence or would ensure control of an undesirable species.},

At higher levels of organization, different macroscopic descriptions of movement also led to different properties at the ecosystem and larger scales.

abstract = {We propose tests for patterns in meta-community structure. The tests for clustering and nestedness of the occurrences of species and negative co-occurrence patterns provide four important innovations. Firstly, they are not restricted to the analysis of communities along one-dimensional gradients or to the main axis of variation. Secondly, abundance data can also be considered in the null model whereas most previous approaches could consider only presence/absence data. And thirdly, habitat suitability and spatial autocorrelation can be incorporated in the null model so that patterns that might be caused by biotic interactions can be distinguished from patterns which are the result of differences in the suitability or accessibility of sites for the examined organisms. Finally, the test for nestedness is also appropriate if there is more than one set of nested subsets. A re-analysis of 35 data sets with these tests showed the importance of considering the autocorrelation of the occurrences of species in analyses of meta-community structure and demonstrated the advantage of abundance data for tests of clustering of species. With abundance data it could be shown that there is a significant clustering of species, i.e. there are positive associations of species in most meta-communities, even if an environmentally or spatially constrained null model is used for the test. Co-occurrence patterns that might indicate interspecific competition were found in many of the analysed presence/absence data sets. Surprisingly the analysis of abundance data sets provides less evidence for interspecific competition. A hierarchical organization of communities, i.e. nestedness, turned out to be a rare pattern, if the autocorrelation of the occurrences of species is considered.},

abstract = {It is often claimed that we do not understand the forces driving the global diversity gradient. However, an extensive literature suggests that contemporary climate constrains terrestrial taxonomic richness over broad geographic extents. Here, we review the empirical literature to examine the nature and form of the relationship between climate and richness. Our goals were to document the support for the climatically based energy hypothesis, and within the constraints imposed by correlative analyses, to evaluate two versions of the hypothesis: the productivity and ambient energy hypotheses. Focusing on studies extending over 800 km, we found that measures of energy, water, or water–energy balance explain spatial variation in richness better than other climatic and non-climatic variables in 82 of 85 cases. Even when considered individually and in isolation, water/ energy variables explain on average over 60{\%} of the variation in the richness of a wide range of plant and animal groups. Further, water variables usually represent the strongest predictors in the tropics, subtropics, and warm temperate zones, whereas energy variables (for animals) or water–energy variables (for plants) dominate in high latitudes.We conclude that the interaction between water and energy, either directly or indirectly (via plant pro- ductivity), provides a strong explanation for globally extensive plant and animal diversity gradients, but for animals there also is a latitudinal shift in the relative importance of ambient energy vs. water moving from the poles to the equator. Although contemporary climate is not the only factor influencing species richness and may not explain the diversity pattern for all taxonomic groups, it is clear that understanding water–energy dynamics is critical to future biodiversity research. Analyses that do not include water–energy variables are missing a key component for explaining broad-scale patterns of diversity.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. Abstract. While local processes (e.g., competition, predation, and disturbance) pre-sumably cause species exclusion and thus limit diversity in individual communities, regional processes (e.g., historical events, immigration, and speciation) are assumed to provide a source of species to colonize and thus enrich local communities. Ecologists have attempted to distinguish between these two sets of processes using graphical evidence for local as-semblage saturation. However, such efforts have been controversial and are antithetical to the fact that local diversity bears an imprint of both. We examine the local-regional species richness relationship from the perspective of the theory of island biogeography and develop a model that can produce the full range of observed local-regional richness relationships from linear to curvilinear. Importantly, unlike previous models, we do not require species interactions to produce the curvilinear pattern. Curvilinear relationships arise if per-species stochastic extinction rates are substantially higher than colonization rates, while linear relationships result if colonization rates are higher than extinction rates. Because we also show that merely changing the sampling scale can make local-regional relationships appear either saturated or unsaturated, an inference of ecological processes, derived solely from local-regional relationships, is unwarranted.},

abstract = {1. The aim of this paper is to review literature on species diversity patterns of freshwater organisms and underlying mechanisms at large spatial scales. 2. Some freshwater taxa (e. g. dragonflies, fish and frogs) follow the classical latitudinal decline in regional species richness (RSR), supporting the patterns found for major terrestrial and marine organism groups. However, the mechanisms causing this cline in most freshwater taxa are inadequately understood, although research on fish suggests that energy and history are major factors underlying the patterns in total species and endemic species richness. Recent research also suggests that not all freshwater taxa comply with the decline of species richness with latitude (e. g. stoneflies, caddisflies and salamanders), but many taxa show more complex geographical patterns in across-regions analyses. These complexities are even more profound when studies of global, continental and regional extents are compared. For example, clear latitudinal gradients may be present in regional studies but absent in global studies (e. g. macrophytes). 3. Latitudinal gradients are often especially weak in the across-ecosystems analyses, which may be attributed to local factors overriding the effects of large-scale factors on local communities. Nevertheless, local species richness (LSR) is typically linearly related to RSR (suggesting regional effects on local diversity), although saturating relationships have also been found in some occasions (suggesting strong local effects on diversity). Nestedness has often been found to be significant in freshwater studies, yet this pattern is highly variable and generally weak, suggesting also a strong beta diversity component in freshwater systems. 4. Both geographical location and local environmental factors contribute to variation in alpha diversity, nestedness and beta diversity in the freshwater realm, although the relative importance of these two groups of explanatory variables may be contingent on the spatial extent of the study. The mechanisms associated with spatial and environmental control of community structure have also been inferred in a number of studies, and most support has been found for species sorting (possibly because many freshwater studies have species sorting as their starting point), although also dispersal limitation and mass effects may be contributing to the patterns found. 5. The lack of latitudinal gradients in some freshwater taxa begs for further explanations. Such explanations may not be gained for most freshwater taxa in the near future, however, because we lack species-level information, floristic and faunistic knowledge, and standardised surveys along extensive latitudinal gradients. A challenge for macroecology is thus to use the best possible species-level information on well-understood groups ( e. g. fish) or use surrogates for species-level patterns (e.g. families) and then develop hypotheses for further testing in the freshwater realm. An additional research challenge concerns understanding patterns and mechanisms associated with the relationships between alpha, beta and gamma components of species diversity. 6. Understanding the mechanistic basis of species diversity patterns should preferably be based on a combination of large-scale macroecological and landscape-scale metacommunity research. Such a research approach will help in elucidating patterns of species diversity across regional and local scales in the freshwater realm.},

I examined the roles of spatial and environmental factors for the structuring of littoral macroinvertebrate communities across a set of lakes in a boreal drainage basin. I hypothesized that dispersal ability would affect the relative importance of spatial processes and environmental control, and thus the biological data were divided into four groups of species differing in dispersal ability. In general, the group of the strongest aerial dispersers showed greatest relative pure environmental control and least pure spatial structuring of community structure and species richness, while spatial processes seemed to be more important for the other three dispersal ability groups. However, these results were contingent on the indirect measure of spatial processes, with the spatial variables and connectivity variables providing slightly different insights into the spatial processes and environmental control of metacommunity structuring. It appears, however, that dispersal ability has effects on the spatial processes and environmental control important in metacommunity organization, with strong dispersers being more under environmental control and less affected by spatial processes compared to weak dispersers.},

abstract = {A topic under intensive study in community ecology and biogeography is the degree to which microscopic, as well as macroscopic organisms, show spatially-structured variation in community characteristics. In general, unicellular microscopic organisms are regarded as ubiquitously distributed and, therefore, without a clear biogeographic signal. This view was summarized 75 years ago by Baas-Becking, who stated “everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects”. Within the context of metacommunity theory, this hypothesis is congruent with the species sorting model. By using a broad-scale dataset on stream diatom communities and environmental predictor variables across most of Finland, our main aim was to test this hypothesis. Patterns of spatial autocorrelation were evaluated by Moran's I based correlograms, whereas partial regression analysis and partial redundancy analysis were used to quantify the relative importance of environmental and spatial factors on total species richness and on community composition, respectively. Significant patterns of spatial autocorrelation were found for all environmental variables, which also varied widely. Our main results were clear-cut. In general, pure spatial effects clearly overcame those of environmental effects, with the former explaining much more variation in species richness and community composition. Most likely, missing environmental variables cannot explain the higher predictive power of spatial variables, because we measured key factors that have previously been found to be the most important variables (e.g. pH, conductivity, colour, phosphorus, nitrogen) shaping the structure of diatom communities. Therefore, our results provided only limited support for the Baas-Becking hypothesis and the species sorting perspective of metacommunity theory.},

We used eigenfunction spatial analysis to model the spatial relationships among sites and distance-based redundancy analysis to partition the variability in biotic communities between the spatial filters generated through spatial eigenfunction analysis and the environmental factors measured in the field. In the smaller study area, each metacommunity was structured mostly by environmental factors. This was evidenced by the fact that either the pure environmental effect was significant or environmental factors were strongly spatially structured. In the larger study area, only pure environmental effects were significant. These findings suggest that the environmental control prevails in boreal headwater streams.

abstract = {SUMMARY 1. Beta diversity modelling has received increased interest recently. There are multiple definitions of beta diversity, but here, we focus on variability in species composition among sampling units within a given area. This facet can be described using various approaches. Some approaches ignore the spa-tial scale of the area considered (i.e. region limits), while some consider different region limits as a starting point for the analysis of beta diversity. 2. We focused specifically on the beta diversity–environmental heterogeneity relationship in running waters. First, we present two conceptual models, which assume either (1) strong environmental con-trol among localities (riffle sites in our case) within each region unit (a region unit encompasses a species pool and can be a stream or a basin or an ecoregion) or (2) that the spatial level of a region unit affects the relative importance of mechanisms affecting variability in species composition among localities (i.e. among riffle sites) within each region unit. Second, we compared three recent studies that used similar methods to examine the beta diversity–environmental heterogeneity relationship, but which were based on different region units, comprising sets of streams or sets of basins or sets of ecoregions. 3. Our conceptual framework assumes that environmental control is not likely to be the sole mecha-nism affecting variability in community composition among localities within each region unit, but it is likely to be most important when dispersal rates are intermediate (i.e. among localities within a basin). In contrast, if dispersal rates are very high (i.e. among localities within a stream) or very low (i.e. among localities within an ecoregion), environmental control is in part masked by high dispersal rates or is prevented from occurring because not all species can reach all localities, respectively. Such scale dependency in the relative strength of environmental control might therefore transcend spatial scales from individual region units to the strength of the beta diversity–environmental heterogeneity relationship. We emphasise that the beta diversity–environmental heterogeneity relationship can only be tested across multiple region units. The results of three case studies are consistent with these pre-dictions. Specifically, the beta diversity–environmental heterogeneity regression was highly signifi-cant across multiple basins, but not across multiple streams or across multiple ecoregions. 4. We suggest that researchers take spatial scale and region unit level explicitly into account when inferring the mechanisms structuring ecological communities and mapping variation in beta diver-sity. We also propose a unified terminology for studies examining the beta diversity–environmental heterogeneity relationship in running waters because inconsistent terminology is likely to hamper the progress of our science.},

abstract = {Other than some classical ideas, large-scale approaches to understand variation in organismal traits (or the trait composition of an ecological community) across stream ecosystems are rather recent. Recent case studies and review papers show clear evidence for the usefulness of trait-based analyses in bioassessment, but how community traits vary along natural gradients at large scales has not yet been synthesised. Here, we attempt to fill this gap by providing a synthesis of trait patterns of stream communities from a macroecological perspective. We argue that although both natural and anthropogenic filters shape community traits, examination of poorly understood natural filters, including those acting at large scales, should receive increasing attention. Such knowledge is vital for reliably inferring anthropogenic impacts on stream communities and ecosystems. We synthesise knowledge of two large-scale spatial patterns of stream communities: among drainage basins (i.e. geographical variation) and within drainage basins (i.e. longitudinal variation). We also examine the temporal dimension of organismal traits. Our review highlights clear evidence for large-scale influences on the trait composition in stream systems. For example, despite previous contentions that organismal traits should vary negligibly across large geographical gradients, there is actually clear geographical variation across near-pristine systems. Furthermore, in accordance with theory, organismal traits in actual data sets vary along the longitudinal gradient of stream systems. We provide an overview of empirical and statistical approaches to understanding the trait composition of stream communities in macroecological studies and conclude that the methodology should be carefully considered in comparisons among studies, because contrasting results may reflect not only ecological differences but also differences in methodology (e.g. choice of species traits, trait quantification and analytical methods). We conclude that the question of how the trait composition of stream communities varies along geographical and environmental gradients is far from settled. A challenge for large-scale stream ecology is to provide a more specific view of trait variation in multiple taxonomic groups (e.g. do traits vary similarly in different organisms groups?), along major environmental gradients (e.g. is trait variation similar along the same environmental gradients in different regions?) and among different regional entities (e.g. do the traits vary, on average, among different regions?).},

abstract = {1. The distribution patterns of unicellular and multicellular organisms have recently been shown to differ profoundly, with the former probably being mostly cosmopolitan, whereas the latter are mostly restricted to certain regions. However, the within-region distribution patterns of these two organism groups may be rather similar. 2. We predicted that the degree of regional occupancy in unicellular eukaryotes would be related to niche characteristics, dispersal ability and size, as has been found previously for multicellular organisms. The niche characteristics we considered were niche position, that measures marginality in species habitat distribution, and niche breadth, that measures amplitude in species habitat distribution. Niche characteristics were determined using Outlying Mean Index (OMI) analysis. 3. We found that the regional occupancy in our model group of unicellular eukaryotes, stream diatoms, was primarily a reflection of the niche position of a species or, more generally, habitat availability. Thus, non-marginal species (i.e. species that occupied common habitat conditions across the region) tended to be more widely distributed than marginal species (i.e. species that were restricted to a limited range of rare habitat conditions). This finding was further supported by the general linear model, with niche position, niche breadth, maximum size and attachment mode as explanatory variables: niche position was by far the most important variable accounting for variability in regional occupancy, with significant amounts of additional variation related to niche breadth and maximum size of diatoms. 4. Thus, the degree of regional occupancy among unicellular eukaryotes may be primarily governed by habitat availability, supporting former findings for multicellular organisms.},

abstract = {Recent findings have suggested that large-scale diversity patterns are primarily driven by widespread species, while rare species are less important in this regard. The degree to which variation in the diversity of local communities in the context of metacommunity ecology concurs with these findings has not been rigorously examined to date. It is also unknown if community turnover along environmental and spatial gradients is mostly attributable to common as opposed to rare species. We examined spatial turnover for three categories of species, all, common, and rare, in seven aquatic metacommunities using simple and partial Mantel tests. We found that variation in turnover along environmental and spatial gradients was generally similar among all, common, and rare species categories, with five of the seven data sets following this pattern. Our findings thus suggest that spatial turnover in aquatic metacommunities can often be adequately described using common species. More importantly, our findings also suggest that turnoverenvironment relationships can also be described relatively well using information from common species only.},

abstract = {Most metacommunity studies have taken a direct mechanistic approach, aiming to model the effects of local and regional processes on local communities within a metacommunity. An alternative approach is to focus on emergent patterns at the metacommunity level through applying the elements of metacommunity structure (EMS; Oikos, 97, 2002, 237) analysis. The EMS approach has very rarely been applied in the context of a comparative analysis of metacommunity types of main microbial, plant, and animal groups. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no study has associated metacommunity types with their potential ecological correlates in the freshwater realm. We assembled data for 45 freshwater metacommunities, incorporating biologically highly disparate organismal groups (i.e., bacteria, algae, macrophytes, invertebrates, and fish). We first examined ecological correlates (e.g., matrix properties, beta diversity, and average characteristics of a metacommunity, including body size, trophic group, ecosystem type, life form, and dispersal mode) of the three elements of metacommunity structure (i.e., coherence, turnover, and boundary clumping). Second, based on those three elements, we determined which metacommunity types prevailed in freshwater systems and which ecological correlates best discriminated among the observed metacommunity types. We found that the three elements of metacommunity structure were not strongly related to the ecological correlates, except that turnover was positively related to beta diversity. We observed six metacommunity types. The most common were Clementsian and quasi-nested metacommunity types, whereas Random, quasi-Clementsian, Gleasonian, and quasi-Gleasonian types were less common. These six metacommunity types were best discriminated by beta diversity and the first axis of metacommunity ecological traits, ranging from metacommunities of producer organisms occurring in streams to those of large predatory organisms occurring in lakes. Our results showed that focusing on the emergent properties of multiple metacommunities provides information additional to that obtained in studies examining variation in local community structure within a metacommunity.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic diversity–area curves are analogous to species–area curves and quantify the relationship between the phylogenetic diversity of species assemblages and the area over which assemblages are sampled. Here, we developed theoretical expectations of these curves under different ecological and macroevolutionary processes. We first used simulations to generate curves expected under three ecological community assembly processes: species sorting, where species have distinct environmental preferences; random placement, where species have no environmental preference but vary in their prevalence across communities; and limited dispersal, where species have no environmental preference but vary in their ability to disperse. Second, we simulated curves expected across regions (e.g., across oceanic islands) that are derived from colonization among regions, within-region speciation, and extinction. We also computed curves for two data sets, one on forest plots along an elevation gradient and the other on Caribbean island Anolis lizards. Of the three ecological processes, only species sorting produced strong relationships between phylogenetic diversity and area. The forest plot curves matched the species-sorting expectation, but only when phylogenetic repulsion (that caused closely related species to be found in similar habitats but not in the same plots) was also included in the simulation. Strong relationships between regional phylogenetic diversity and area were simulated if species were derived only from within-region speciation; colonizations among regions obscured the pattern. Similarly, larger Caribbean islands had more within- island speciation and contained more Anolis phylogenetic diversity than smaller islands, but colonizations among islands obscured this relationship. This work furthers our understanding of the processes that govern the phylogenetic diversity of ecological communities and biogeographic regions.},

abstract = {A case study of hyporheic research in a northern Michigan river is presented to illustrate some potential effects of subsurface hydrology on microbial ecology. Hydrologic flow between a downwelling and an upwelling zone beneath a riffle-pool sequence promoted hyporheic-ground- water interaction and differentiated regions of increased bacterial activity, production, turnover time, and responsiveness to dissolved organic carbon enrichment. Large gaps in knowledge exist on the structure and function of fungal, bacterial, microalgal, protozoan, and micrometazoan as- semblages within hyporheic zones. This study, combined with available literature on surface and groundwater microbial assemblages, generated several hypotheses for future research. Hydrological methods, when coupled with biochemical measurements, micro-techniques, and descriptions of hyporheic physicochemical and biological gradients, can potentially contribute to a greater under- standing of the role of hyporheic microbial communities in the structure and function of lotic ecosystems.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Endospores formed by Bacillus, Clostridia, and related genera are encased in a protein shell called the coat. In many species, including B. subtilis, the coat is the outermost spore structure, and in other species, such as the pathogenic organisms B. anthracis and R. cereus, the spore is encased in an additional layer called the exosporium. Both the coat and the exosporium have roles in protection of the spore and in its environmental interactions. Assembly of both structures is a function of the mother cell, one of two cellular compartments of the developing sporangium. Studies in R. subtilis have revealed that the timing of coat protein production, the guiding role of a small group of morphogenetic proteins, and several types of post-translational modifications are essential for the fidelity of the assembly process. Assembly of the exosporium requires a set of novel proteins as well as homologues of proteins found in the outermost layers of the coat and of some of the coat morphogenetic factors, suggesting that the exosporium is a more specialized structure of a multifunctional coat. These and other insights into the molecular details of spore surface morphogenesis provide avenues for exploitation of the spore surface layers in applications for biotechnology and medicine.},

abstract = {Bidirectional (hyporheic) exchange of water between stream channels and sediments benefits stream ecosystems, yet the effects of urbanization on such exchange are poorly understood. Exchange is controlled by a set of geomorphic parameters collectively defined as "hyporheic potential," including sediment hydraulic conductivity (K), vertical undulations of the streambed (VC), and channel sinuosity (S). We measured these hyporheic potential metrics in 10 stream reaches with varying percent impervious surface (0-47 percent) in their contributing watersheds. We performed linear regression between hyporheic potential metrics and two metrics of urbanization: percent impervious in the watershed and average riparian forest buffer width. We found that most trends between hyporheic potential metrics and both urbanization metrics were noisy, with low r2. Furthermore, hyporheic potential varied as much among our streams as in non-urban studies, and K varied as much within stream reaches as between stream reaches. These results collectively indicate that the effects of urbanization on hyporheic potential in our streams were minimal and that urbanization may not heavily constrain hyporheic exchange. Nevertheless, we did find that S increased with impervious cover in the contributing watershed, consistent with higher urban storm flows leading to sinuosity adjustments to reduce channel slope. Urbanization may therefore enhance hyporheic potential under certain circumstances, and bears further study. Furthermore, there may be value in increasing the benefits of hyporheic exchange above existing levels through "hyporheic enhancement." Because K varied more among streams than VC, which varied more than S, efforts to enhance hyporheic exchange may have greatest effect if they manipulate K.},

abstract = {The hyporheic zone is the area of mixing of surface and groundwater beneath and adjacent to streams and rivers. The unique physical, chemical, and biological properties of the hyporheic zone, often different from both surface water and deeper groundwater, create unique habitat for organisms. Exchange of water between surface water and the hyporheic zone additionally creates hyporheic functions such as nutrient processing, toxin mineralization, and thermal buffering, which benefit surface water ecosystems and humans downstream. Human activities have reduced hyporheic exchange through impacts such as channel simplification and introduction of fine sediment that clogs the bed. Efforts to improve ecological conditions in impaired streams and rivers have increased dramatically in recent decades. Nevertheless, the value of restoring hyporheic exchange, where it has been lost due to human actions (hyporheic restoration) as a component of stream and river restoration, is only beginning to be acknowledged. Further, guidance for accomplishing hyporheic restoration is scarce. Nevertheless, due to considerable recent interest in the hyporheic zone and its functions, data that could inform hyporheic restoration efforts are already fairly common. Here we lay out possible goals for hyporheic restoration and summarize engineering data that already exist in the scientific literature. We also lay out the hyporheic restoration process and set that within the largest context of stream and river restoration and watershed planning. Finally, we present our future vision for future research, creating design and management guidance, and government leadership.},

This article discusses heterogeneity, scaling, and design analysis problems and offers potential solutions to improve empirically based research. In particular, we recommend bridging the dichotomy between correlative and manipulative studies by nesting manipulative studies within a correlative framework. We suggest that building on variation, by designing studies to detect variability, rather than fighting it often leads to an increase in generality. We also emphasize the importance of natural history information for determining likely scales of spatial and temporal heterogeneity and the probable occurrence of feedback loops, indirect effects, and interacting processes. Finally, we integrate these concepts and suggest planned iterations between multiscale studies to build up natural history information and test the strength of relationships across space and time. This offers a way forward in terms of heuristically developing models and determining ecological generalities.},

abstract = {We used metatranscriptomics to study the gene transcription patterns of microbial plankton (0.2 to 64 mu m) at a mesohaline station in the Chesapeake Bay under transitions from oxic to anoxic waters in spring and from anoxic to oxic waters in autumn. Samples were collected from surface (i.e., above pycnocline) waters (3 m) and from waters beneath the pycnocline (16 to 22 m) in both 2010 and 2011. Metatranscriptome profiles based on function and potential phylogeny were different between 2010 and 2011 and strongly variable in 2011. This difference in variability corresponded with a highly variable ratio of eukaryotic to bacterial sequences (0.3 to 5.5), reflecting transient algal blooms in 2011 that were absent in 2010. The similarity between metatranscriptomes changed at a lower rate during the transition from oxic to anoxic waters than after the return to oxic conditions. Transcripts related to photosynthesis and low-affinity cytochrome oxidases were significantly higher in shallow than in deep waters, while in deep water genes involved in anaerobic metabolism, particularly sulfate reduction, succinyl coenzyme A (succinyl- CoA)-to-propionyl-CoA conversion, and menaquinone synthesis, were enriched relative to in shallow waters. Expected transitions in metabolism between oxic and anoxic deep waters were reflected in elevated levels of anaerobic respiratory reductases and utilization of propenediol and acetoin. The percentage of archaeal transcripts increased in both years in late summer (from 0.1 to 4.4{\%} of all transcripts in 2010 and from 0.1 to 6.2{\%} in 2011). Denitrification-related genes were expressed in a predicted pattern during the oxic-anoxic transition. Overall, our data suggest that Chesapeake Bay microbial assemblages express gene suites differently in shallow and deep waters and that differences in deep waters reflect variable redox states.},

abstract = {Macromoth diversity, abundance, and community structure in the topographically complex HJ Andrews Experimental Forest and LTER site was studied on the west slope of the Cascade Range, Oregon. Data on 493 macromoth species (62,221 individuals) was sampled eight times/year at 20 locations from 2004 to 2008 and examined using multivariate statistics and generalized additive models to determine the importance of topography and vegetation on moth community assembly and diversity. Significant differences exist between moth communities at lower and higher elevations. High-elevation moth communities are far more variable inter-annually, whether associated with high-elevation forests, meadows, or clearcuts. Low-elevation young and old gymnosperm forests and riparian forests are more stable and predictable communities having less inter-annual variability. High-elevation communities show more intra-annual variability than low-elevation communities. Low-elevation moth communities are more abundant than high-elevation communities and typically associated with the most common, abundant species of macromoths in the study. High-elevation communities, by contrast, are associated with less abundant, more evenly distributed species, as well as with rare moth species. Macromoth community structure and diversity were related to year or sample period and structural descriptions of vegetation communities, but not related to known host-plant diversity. High-elevation communities are threatened by contraction of montane meadows and climate change which, given the variability in high-elevation communities, could severely impact the biological diversity of the western Cascades landscape. Nocturnal macromoths represent an important potential indicator of ecosystem health and change.},

abstract = {1. We measured NH4+ and PO4- 3 uptake length (S-w), uptake velocity (V-f), uptake rate (U), biofilm respiration and enzyme activity and channel geomorphology in streams draining forested catchments in the northwestern (Northern California Coast Range and Cascade Mountains) and southeastern (Appalachian and Ouachita mountains) regions of the United States. Our goal was to use measures of biofilm enzyme activity and nutrient uptake to assess nutrient limitation in forested streams across broad regional scales. 2. Geomorphological attributes, biofilm enzyme activity and NH4+ uptake were significantly different among streams in the four study units. There was no study unit effect on PO4-3 uptake. The proportion of the stream channel in pools, {\%} woody debris, {\%} canopy closure, median substrate size (d(50)), stream width (w), stream velocity (v), discharge (Q), dispersion coefficient (D) and transient storage (A(s)/A) were correlated with biofilm enzyme activity and nutrient uptake in some study units. 3. Canonical correlation analyses across study units revealed significant correlations of NH4-V-f and PO4-V-f with geomorphological attributes (w, d(50), D, {\%} woody debris, channel slope and {\%} pools) and biofilm phosphatase activity. 4. The results did not support our expectation that carbon processing rates by biofilm microbial assemblages would be governed by stream nutrient availability or that resulting biofilm enzyme activity would be an indicator of nutrient uptake. However, the relative abundances of peptidases, phosphatase and glycosidases did yield insight into potential N-, P-and C-limitation of stream biofilm assemblages, and our use of biofilm enzyme activity represents a novel application for understanding nutrient limitations in forested streams. 5. Regressions of V-f and U against ambient NH4+ and PO4-3 indicated that none of our study streams was either NH4+ or PO4-3 saturated. The Appalachian, Ouachita and Coastal streams showed evidence of NH4+ limitation; the Ouachita and Coastal streams were PO4-3 limited. As a correlate of nutrient limitation and saturation in streams, ratios of total aminopeptidase and phosphatase activities and the ratio of NH4-u to PO4-u indicate these forested streams are predominantly N-limited, with only the streams draining Ouachita and Coastal catchments demonstrating appreciable levels of P-limitation.},

abstract = {Habitat destruction is a critical factor that affects persistence in several taxa, including Pacific salmon. Salmon are noted for their ability to home to their natal streams for reproduction. Since straying (i.e., spawners reproducing in nonnatal streams) is typically low in salmon, its effects have not been appreciated. In this article, we develop both a general analytical model and a simple simulation model describing structured metapopulations to study how weak connections between subpopulations affect the ability of a species to tolerate habitat destruction and/or declines in habitat quality. Our goals are to develop general principles and to relate these principles to salmon population dynamics. The analytical model describes the dynamics of two density-dependent subpopulations, connected by dispersal, whose growth rates fluctuate in response to environmental and demographic stochasticity. We find that, for moderate levels of environmental variability, small dispersal rates can significantly increase mean extinction times. This effect declines with increasing habitat quality, increasing temporal correlation, and increasing spatial correlation, but it is still significant for realistic parameter values. The simulation model shows there is a threshold rate of dispersal that minimizes extinction probabilities. These results cannot be seen in classical metapopulation models and provide new insights into the rescue effect.},

A unified concept of diversity is presented, according to which there is a continuum of possible diversity measures. In a sense which becomes apparent, these measures provide estimates of the effective number of species present, and differ only in their tendency to include or to ignore the relatively rarer species. The notion of the diversity of a community as opposed to that of a sample is examined, and is related to the asymptotic form of the species—abundance curve.

abstract = {We present a stochastic model for metapopulations in landscapes with a finite but arbitrary number of patches. The model, similar in form to the chain-binomial epidemic models, is an absorbing Markov chain that describes changes in the number of occupied patches as a sequence of binomial probabilities. It predicts the quasiequilibrium distribution of occupied patches, the expected extinction time ({\textless}({\textless}tau{\textgreater})over bar{\textgreater}), and the probability of persistence ((l) over bar (x)) to time x as a function of the number N of patches in the landscape and the number S of those patches that are suitable for the population. For a given value of N, the model shows that: (1) {\textless}({\textless}tau{\textgreater})over bar{\textgreater} and (l) over bar (x) are highly sensitive to changes in S and (2) there is a threshold value of S at which {\textless}({\textless}tau{\textgreater})over bar{\textgreater} declines abruptly from extremely large to very small values. We also describe a statistical method for estimating model parameters from time series data in order to evaluate metapopulation viability in real landscapes. An example is presented using published data on the Glanville fritillary butterfly, Meltiaea cinxia, and its specialist parasitoid Cotesia melitaearum. We calculate the expected extinction time of M. cinxia as a function of the frequency of parasite outbreaks, and are able to predict the minimum number of years between outbreaks required to ensure long-term persistence of M. cinxia. The chain-binomial model provides a simple but powerful method for assessing the effects of human and natural disturbances on extinction times and persistence probabilities in finite landscapes.},

abstract = {The global decline of biodiversity caused by human domination of ecosystems worldwide is supposed to alter important process rates and state variables in these ecosystems. However, there is considerable debate on the prevalence and importance of biodiversity effects on ecosystem function (BDEF). Here, we argue that much of the debate stems from two major shortcomings. First, most studies do not directly link the traits leading to increased or decreased function to the traits needed for species coexistence and dominance. We argue that implementing a trait-based approach and broadening the perception of diversity to include trait dissimilarity or trait divergence will result in more realistic predictions on the consequences of altered biodiversity. Second, the empirical and theoretical studies do not reflect the complexity of natural ecosystems, which makes it difficult to transfer the results to natural situations of species loss. We review how different aspects of complexity (trophic structure, multifunctionality, spatial or temporal heterogeneity, and spatial population dynamics) alter our perception of BDEF. We propose future research avenues concisely testing whether acknowledging this complexity will strengthen the observed biodiversity effects. Finally, we propose that a major future task is to disentangle biodiversity effects on ecosystem function from direct changes in function due to human alterations of abiotic constraints.},

abstract = {Each family of the desert isopod Hemilepistus reaumuri uses its faeces to build an embankment around its burrow entrance in the form of a ring with an inner radius of 5-10 cm and an outer radius of 8-15 cm. Although the embankment, like the burrow entrance, is detected only by contact with the antennae, it facilitates the return to the burrow after an excursion. When a desert isopod returns from foraging it reaches the burrow entrance itself (diameter 12 mm) only in ca. 12{\%} of the observed cases by "dead reckoning"; the embankment, however, is reached six times more frequently. After detecting this landmark an isopod needs a further 12{\%} of the pathlength of the preceding excursion to locate the burrow entrance. In contrast, it travels five times further to reach its burrow from the same distance (10 cm) if the landmark is missing. The landmark is even more important when the isopod, because of a large error in orientation, can reach its burrow only by searching. Both the characteristics of the search path of H. reaumuri and the success of it's search behaviour correspond well to the respective features of a theoretical procedure, which best solves the search problem of the desert isopods assuming that a landmark is available for orientation. The optimal search procedure was calculated by using information about the probability density that an error in orientation has a given size, and the cumulative probability that the landmark is detected if the isopod searches in it's region with a given intensity. The coupling of the systematic search strategy of H. reaumuri with landmark orientation shortens the average time needed for homing by one-third. It helps an isopod to return to it's burrow after foraging even if all the orientation mechanisms normally used for this task have broken down.},

abstract = {Denitrification was measured in hyporheic, parafluvial, and bank sediments of Sycamore Creek, Arizona, a nitrogen-limited Sonoran Desert stream. We used three variations of the acetylene block technique to estimate denitrification rates, and compared these esti- mates to rates of nitrate production through nitrification. Subsurface sediments of Sycamore Creek are typically well-oxygenated, relatively low in nitrate, and low in organic carbon, and therefore are seemingly unlikely sites of denitrification. However, we found that denitrification potential (C {\&} N amended, anaerobic incubations) was substantial, and even by our conserva- tive estimates (unamended, oxic incubations and field chamber nitrous oxide accumulation), denitrification consumed 5-40{\%} of nitrate produced by nitrification. We expected that denitrifi- cation would increase along hyporheic and parafluvial flowpaths as dissolved oxygen declined and nitrate increased. To the contrary, we found that denitrification was generally highest at the upstream ends of subsurface flowpaths where surface water had just entered the subsurface zone. This suggests that denitrifiers may be dependenton the import of surface-derived organic matter, resulting in highest denitrification rate at locations of surface-subsurface hydrologic exchange. Laboratory experiments showed that denitrification in Sycamore Creek sediments was primarily nitrogen limited and secondarily carbon limited, and was temperature dependent. Overall, the quantity of nitrate removed from the Sycamore Creek ecosystem via denitrification is significant given the nitrogen-limited status of this stream.},

abstract = {When multiple victim species (e.g. prey, host) are attacked by one or more shared enemy species (e.g. predator, pathogen), the potential exists for apparent competition between victim populations. We review ideas on apparent competition (also called ''competition for enemy-free space'') and sketch illustrative examples. One puzzling aspect of this indirect interaction is the repeated rediscovery of the essential ideas. Apparent competition arises between focal and alternative prey populations because, in the long term, enemy abundance depends on total prey availability; by increasing enemy numbers, alternative prey intensify predation on focal prey. A frequent empirical finding, consistent with theory, is exclusion of victim species from local communities by resident enemies. Theory suggests victim-species coexistence depends on particular conditions. To understand fully the consequences of shared enemies requires a body of contingent theory, specifying the time-scale of the interactions (short-and long-term consequences of sharing enemies generally differ), the structure of the food-web encompassing the interactions, its spatial context, etc. The ''core criterion'' for a focal victim species to invade a community supporting a resident, polyphagous enemy is r {\textgreater} aP (the invader's intrinsic rate of increase should exceed attack rate times average enemy abundance). A growing body of data and observations test, and support, this prediction.},

Here, we examine the influence of immigration on the evolution of local adaptation, given an Allee effect (i.e., at low densities, absolute fitness increases with population density). We consider a deterministic model for evolution at a haploid locus, and a stochastic individual-based model for evolution of a quantitative trait, and several kinds of Allee effects. We demonstrate that increased immigration can greatly facilitate adaptive evolution in the sink; with greater immigration, local population sizes rise, and because of the Allee effect, there is a positive indirect effect of immigration on local fitness. This makes it easier for alleles of modest effect to be captured by natural selection, transforming the sink into a locally adapted population that can persist without immigration.},

abstract = {It is argued that alternate prey species in the diet of a food-limited generalist predator should reduce each other's equilibrial abundances, whether or not they directly compete. Such indirect, interspecific interactions are labeled apparent competition. Two examples are discussed in which an observed pattern of habitat segregation was at first interpreted as evidence for direct competition, but later interpreted as apparent competition resulting from shared predation. In order to study the consequences of predator-mediated apparent competition in isolation from other complicating factors, a model community is analyzed in which there is no direct interspecific competition among the prey. An explicit necessary condition for prey species coexistence is derived for the case of one predator feeding on many prey species. This model community has several interesting properties: (1) Prey species with high relative values for a parameter ra are “keystone” species in the community; (2) prey species can be excluded from the community by “diffuse” apparent competition; (3) large changes in the niche breadth of the predator need not correspond to large changes in predator density; (4) the prey trophic level as a whole is regulated by the predator, yet each of its constituent species is regulated by both the predator and available resources; (5) increased productivity may either increase, decrease, or leave unchanged the number of species in the community; (6) a decrease in density-independent mortality may decrease species diversity. These conclusions seem to be robust to changes in the prey growth equations and to the incorporation of predator satiation. By contrast, adding prey refugia or predator switching to the model weakens these conclusions. If the predator can be satiated or switched, the elements aij comprising the community matrix may have signs opposite the long-term effect of j upon i. The effect of natural selection upon prey species coexistence is discussed. Unless ri, Ki, and ai are tightly coupled, natural selection within prey species i will tend to decrease the equilibrial abundance of species j.},

abstract = {I explore the relation between optimal foraging and the geometrical character of the predator isocline. Two basic models are discussed. The first is a multispecies generalization of Holling's "disc" equation. If a predator can rapidly discriminate among prey types, it is argued that its isoclines should not have positive slopes. Isoclines with positive slopes may occur if the predator must invest time dis- criminating between prey of unequal value, and there is a high absolute abundance of the better quality prey species. For a food-limited predator, however, selection should moderate the degree of rightward slope. In the second model, encounter and capture rates vary directly with relative prey abundance because of switching behavior. A number of published switching models are shown to produce isoclines with partially positive slopes. If the attack rates on each of two prey species are functionally related, it is argued that an optimally foraging predator will either have rectangular isoclines or isoclines with negative slope. This suggests that existing switching models are not completely satisfactory representations of switching behavior. A few examples of predators with isoclines of positive slope have been observed. Some possible mechanisms for generating such isoclines are discussed briefly. Several central ideas in community theory would founder were predators often to have isoclines with positive slopes},

abstract = {The effect of dispersal on population size and stability is explored for a population that disperses passively between two discrete habitat patches. Two basic models are considered. In the first model, a single population experiences density-dependent growth in both patches. A graphical construction is presented which allows one to determine the spatial pattern of abundance at equilibrium for most reasonable growth models and rates of dispersal. It is shown under rather general conditions that this equilibrium is unique and globally stable. In the second model, the dispersing population is a food-limited predator that occurs in both a source habitat (which contains a prey population) and a sink habitat (which does not). Passive dispersal between source and sink habitats can stabilize an otherwise unstable predator-prey interaction. The conditions allowing this are explored in some detail. The theory of optimal habitat selection predicts the evolutionarily stable distribution of a population, given that individuals can freely move among habitats so as to maximize individual fitness. This theory is used to develop a heuristic argument for why passive dispersal should always be selectively disadvantageous (ignoring kin effects) in a spatially heterogeneous but temporally constant environment. For both the models considered here, passive dispersal may lead to a greater number of individuals in both habitats combined than if there were no dispersal. This implies that the evolution of an optimal habitat distribution may lead to a reduction in population size; in the case of the predator-prey model, it may have the additional effect of destabilizing the interaction. The paper concludes with a discussion of the disparate effects habitat selection might have on the geographical range occupied by a species.},

abstract = {G. Evelyn Hutchinson more than a half century ago proposed that one could characterize the ecological niche of a species as an abstract mapping of population dynamics onto an environmental space, the axes of which are abiotic and biotic factors that influence birth and death rates. If a habitat has conditions within a species' niche, a population should persist without immigration from external sources, whereas if conditions are outside the niche, it faces extinction. Analyses of species' niches are essential to understanding controls on species' geographical range limits and how these limits might shift in our rapidly changing world. Recent developments in ecology and evolutionary biology suggest it is time to revisit and refine Hutchinson's niche concept. After reviewing techniques for quantifying niches, I examine subtleties that arise because of impacts species have on their own environments, the density-dependent modulation of how individuals experience environments, and the interplay of dispersal and temporal heterogeneity in determining population persistence. Moreover, the evolutionary record over all time scales reveals a spectrum of rates of change in species' niches, from rapid niche evolution to profound niche conservatism. Substantial challenges revolving around the evolutionary dimension of the Hutchinsonian niche include quantifying the magnitude of evolved intraspecific and clade-level variation in niches and understanding the factors that govern where along the spectrum of potential evolutionary rates any given lineage lies. A growing body of theory provides elements of a conceptual framework for understanding niche conservatism and evolution, paving the way for an evolutionary theory of the niche.},

Theoretical models suggest short-term responses to a single pulse can qualitatively differ from longer-term responses. Recurrent resource pulses can alter community structure, permitting coexistence that otherwise would not occur, or hamper coexistence mechanisms effective in stable environments. For a given resource input, system responses can be more dramatic with short pulses. Resource pulses can cause transitions between alternative states. Dispersal permits species to exploit locally sporadic resource pulses and persist in environments that on average are unsuitable. All these issues are ripe for further theoretical explorations.},

abstract = {Because mechanistic models of interspecific interactions are often complex, one should deliberately seek simple unifying principles that transcend system-specific details. Earlier work on resource competition has led to the "R* rule," which states that a dominant competitor suppresses resources to a lower level than any other competing species. This rule describes the outcome of even ornate models of competition. Here we show that analogous simple rules can characterize systems with predation. We first demonstrate, for a simple two-prey, one-predator model without resource competition but with a predator numerical response leading to apparent competition, that the winning prey supports (and withstands) the higher predator density; that is, the outcome is described by a "P* rule." We then develop a general model in which predation is inflicted evenhandedly on two prey species competing for a single resource and show that the R* and P* rules hold: the winning prey both depresses resources to the lowest level and sustains the higher predator density. We next examine a more complex model with differential predation. Assuming a closed system (i.e., a fixed nutrient pool), we portray the four- dimensional system dynamics in a two-dimensional graphical model, and we assess the domain of applicability of simple dominance rules in more complex systems. We address the generality of our conclusions and end by examining the implications of different, reasonable biological constraints for community structure.},

Yet, many natural IGP systems robustly persist. Standard models of intraguild predation simplify natural systems in crucial ways that could influence persistence; in particular, many empirical IGP systems are embedded in communities with alternative prey species. We briefly review the key conclusions of standard three-species IGP theory, and then present results of theoretical explorations of how alternative prey can influence the persistence and stability of a focal intraguild predation interaction.},

Elucidating patterns of gene flow to, and returning from, peripheral populations can provide important insights into the nature of adaptation, speciation and coevolution. Species' borders form natural laboratories for the study of the spatial structure of species interactions. Comparative studies from the center to the margin of species' ranges allow us to explore species' demographic responses along gradients of increasing environmental stress. Range dynamics further permit investigation into invasion dynamics and represent bellwethers for a changing climate.

Population dynamic models provide insight into the different routes by which range limits can arise owing to gradients in demographic rates. In a metapopulation context, for example, range limits may be caused by gradients in extinction rates, colonization rates or habitat availability.

abstract = {Interspecific interactions reflect the cumulative consequences of individual behavioral acts. The foraging decisions made by predators influence the way in which predation shapes the structure of prey communities. Alternative prey species co-occurring in a patch embedded in a matrix of many similar patches may interact through a shared mobile predator in two distinct ways. First, the functional response by an individual predator foraging in the patch to one prey species may be affected by the density of a second prey species in the patch (e.g., any time spent handling one prey reduces the time available for capturing other prey). Second, the presence of a second prey species may alter the propensity of predators to aggregate or remain in a given patch. We argue that this aggregative numerical response can in many circumstances generate -, - interactions (apparent competition) between prey species that otherwise would not interact. This is most likely if predators use a simple optimality criterion for prey selectivity within patches and the marginal-value theorem for deciding when to enter and leave patches. By contrast, if predators have suboptimal diets within patches but leave in accord with the marginal-value theorem, alternative prey may experience a +, - interaction; and, if predators use patches independently of prey availability, a +, + interaction between alternative prey can occur. Hence, the qualitative character of the interaction between alternative prey in a patchy environment depends on the degree to which predators do, or do not, match the canonical predictions of optimal foraging theory.

abstract = {The species-area relationship may be the strongest empirical generalization in community ecology. We explore the effect of trophic rank upon the "strength" of the species-area relationship, as measured by z, the slope of a log(species) vs. log(area) plot. We present a simple model for communities closed to immigration, composed of "stacked specialist" food chains (where each plant species supports a specialist herbivore, which in turn sustains a specialist carnivore, etc.), that predicts z should increase with trophic rank; the model brings out some of the spatial implications of sequential dependencies among species. We discuss empirical examples in which the z values of taxa differing in trophic rank were reported and lament the shortage of well-documented examples in the ecological literature. Several examples fit the expected pattern, but others do not. We outline several additional reasons why z values might increase with trophic rank, even for generalists. If the qualitative assumptions of the model are relaxed, the predicted effect of trophic rank on z should weaken or even be reversed. Trophic rank may not have a systematic effect on the species-area relationship if (1) there are strong top-down interactions leading to prey extinctions; (2) communities are open, with recurrent immigration, particularly at higher trophic ranks; (3) consumers are facultative generalists, able to exist on a wide range of resource species; or (4) systems are far from equilibrium. Our aim in this thought piece is to stimulate community ecologists to link theoretical and empirical studies of food web structure with analyses of spatial dynamics and landscape ecology, and to encourage em- pirical studies of the species-area relationship focused on comparisons across taxa varying in trophic rank.},

abstract = {Many important issues in community ecology revolve around the interplay of compe- tition and predation. Species that compete may also be locked in predator-prey interactions, a mixture of competition and predation known as "intraguild predation" (IGP). There is growing evidence for the importance of IGP in many natural communities, yet little formal ecological theory addresses this particular blend of interactions. In this article, we explore the conse- quences of incorporating IGP into standard models of exploitative competition and food chains (a general resource-consumer model, a Lotka-Volterra food chain model, and Schoener's ex- ploitative competition model). Our theoretical analyses suggest a general criterion for coexis- tence in IGP systems: the intermediate species (the prey in intraguild predation) should be superior at exploitative competition for the shared resource, whereas the top species (the preda- tor) should gain significantly from its consumption of the intermediate species. Along gradients in environmental productivity, coexistence is most likely at intermediate levels of productivity. Analyses of the models reveal the potential for alternative stable states in systems with IGP; these are particularly likely if the top predator gains little benefit from consuming the intermedi- ate predator. We further show that IGP can lead to unstable population dynamics, even when all pairwise interactions are inherently stable and each species can increase when rare. Persis- tent, strong IGP raises a puzzle of species coexistence, particularly in productive environments. We conclude by comparing IGP with related community modules (i.e., food chains, exploitative competition, apparent competition) and discussing mechanisms that should foster coexistence in systems with strong IGP.},

abstract = {Although insight into local and regional factors that structure communities is growing, the specific contribution of each of these factors generally remains unknown. Moreover, the extent to which community assembly is intrinsically indeterministic (i.e., the degree to which community composition depends on chance events) remains an open question. The complexity of this issue argues for field studies in a semicontrolled envi- ronment. We studied species richness and community composition of a guild of phreato- phytes along dendritic networks of small forest streams in western Belgium. The streams, situated at the forest-covered headwaters of six different watersheds and characterized by homogeneous environmental conditions, impose spatial dispersal constraints to the plant species. This allowed us to assess the relative importance of deterministic processes guiding community assembly. More specifically, we focused on the role of species migration and colonization processes relative to local processes (competitive exclusion and passive habitat selection) on species richness and on community composition. Our analyses at three con- secutive levels (species number, community composition, and species) revealed that plant community assembly along the stream systems is based on (1) historical and stochastic colonization events of species and (2) subsequent deterministic downstream dispersal pro- cesses. Apparently, due to the influence of historical chance events, deterministic processes do not necessarily result in community convergence. In addition we show that continuous downstream dispersal and colonization can compensate for local extinction processes. This is another piece of evidence that, when studying community composition, it is absolutely necessary to place communities in their spatial contexts.},

abstract = {1 The hydrologic and biogeochemical responses of forested watersheds to inputs of rainfall and snowmelt can be an indicator of internal watershed function. In this study, we assess how the quantity and quality, both chemical and spectroscopic, of stream water DOC changes in response to a 6-day storm event during the wet season of 2003 in three small 1 km(2)) basins in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon. The watersheds included one old-growth watershed WS02) and two previously logged watersheds WS01 and WS10). Prestorm concentrations of DOC ranged from 1.5 to 2.2 mg C L-1 in the three watersheds and increased approximately threefold on the ascending limb of the storm hydrograph. Concentrations of DOC were both highest in the unharvested, old-growth watershed. The specific UV absorbance SUVA, 254 nm) of DOC in the three watersheds increased by 9 to 36{\%} during the storm, suggesting that DOC mobilized from catchment soils during storms is more aromatic than DOC entering the stream during baseflow. The increase in SUVA was most pronounced in the previously harvested catchments. Chromatographic fractionation of DOC showed that the percentage of DOC composed of non-humic material decreasing by 9 to 22{\%} during the storm. Shifts in the fluorescence properties of DOC suggest that there was not a pronounced change in the relative proportion of stream water DOC derived from allochthonous versus autochthonous precursor material. Taken together, these results suggest that spectroscopic and chemical characterization of DOC can be used as tools to investigate changing sources of DOC and water within forested watersheds.},

abstract = {We investigated how the source and chemical character of aquatic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) change over the course of the runoff season (May-November, 1999) in Green Lakes Valley, a high-elevation ecosystem in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Samples were collected on North Boulder Creek from four sites across an alpine/subalpine ecotone in order to understand how the transition from the lightly vegetated alpine to the forested reaches of the catchment influences aquatic DOC. Concentrations of DOC at the four sites peaked between 2.6 and 8.9 mg C L-1 on the ascending limb of the snowmelt hydrograph, with the higher concentrations at the two subalpine sites. Seasonally, the chemical fractionation of DOC showed that there was a large range (29-72{\%}) in the fulvic acid content of DOC at the four sites, with the highest fulvic acid percentages on the ascending limb of the hydrograph. Yields of DOC at the two gauged sites ranged from 10 to 11 kg ha(-1) over the season with between 45 and 50{\%} of the yield occurring as fulvic acid DOC and the remainder as nonhumic material. The fluorescence properties of DOC from all four sites indicated that during peak runoff, DOC was derived primarily from terrestrial precursor material. However, seasonal changes in the fluorescence properties of fulvic acids at the highest elevation sites suggest that DOC derived from algal and microbial biomass in the lakes is a more important source of DOC above tree line during late summer and fall. We hypothesize that much of the autochthonous DOC production is a result of algal growth in alpine lakes. Further, comparison to a forested control catchment suggests that processes in the alpine reach of the catchment may alter both the amount and chemistry of DOC incident to the downstream subalpine aquatic system.},

@article{Of2005,
abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

Here we describe a taxa-area relationship for bacteria over a scale of centimetres to hundreds of metres in salt marsh sediments.

We use a null model analysis of 124 incidence matrices from microbial communities, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, and algae, and we compare these results to previously published findings from a meta-analysis of almost 100 macroorganism data sets. We show that assemblages of microorganisms demonstrate nonrandom patterns of co-occurrence that are broadly similar to those found in assemblages of macroorganisms. These results suggest that some taxon co-occurrence patterns may be general characteristics of communities of organisms from all domains of life. We also find that co-occurrence in microbial communities does not vary among taxonomic groups or habitat types. However, we find that the degree of co-occurrence does vary among studies that use different methods to survey microbial communities. Finally, we discuss the potential effects of the undersampling of microbial communities on our results, as well as processes that may contribute to nonrandom patterns of co-occurrence in both macrobial and microbial communities such as competition, habitat filtering, historical effects, and neutral processes.},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

abstract = {In population ecology, there has been a fundamental controversy about the relative importance of competition-driven (density-dependent) population regulation vs. abiotic influences such as temperature and precipitation. The same issue arises at the community level; are population sizes driven primarily by changes in the abundances of cooccurring competitors (i.e., compensatory dynamics), or do most species have a common response to environmental factors? Competitive interactions have had a central place in ecological theory, dating back to Gleason, Volterra, Hutchison and MacArthur, and, more recently, Hubbell's influential unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography. If competitive interactions are important in driving year-to-year fluctuations in abundance, then changes in the abundance of one species should generally be accompanied by compensatory changes in the abundances of others. Thus, one necessary consequence of strong compensatory forces is that, on average, species within communities will covary negatively. Here we use measures of community covariance to assess the prevalence of negative covariance in 41 natural communities comprising different taxa at a range of spatial scales. We found that species in natural communities tended to covary positively rather than negatively, the opposite of what would be expected if compensatory dynamics were important. These findings suggest that abiotic factors such as temperature and precipitation are more important than competitive interactions in driving year-to-year fluctuations in species abundance within communities.},

Others argue that nutrients are not limiting at all nmany marine ecosystems, including highly oligotrophic waters. To some extent these disagreements result from poor communication due to different definitions of nutrient limitation.

abstract = {Metacommunity theory suggests that relationships between diversity and ecosystem stability can be determined by the rate of species dispersal among local communities. The predicted relationships, however, may depend upon the relative strength of local environmental processes and disturbance. Here we evaluate the role of dispersal frequency and local predation perturbations in affecting patterns of diversity and stability in pond plankton metacommunities. Pond metacommunities were composed of three mesocosm communities: one of the three communities maintained constant "press" predation from a selective predator, bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus); the second community maintained "press" conditions without predation; and the third community experienced recurrent "pulsed" predation from bluegill sunfish. The triads of pond communities were connected at either no, low (0.7{\%}/d), or high (20{\%}/d) planktonic dispersal. Richness and composition of zooplankton and stability of plankton biomass and ecosystem productivity were measured at local and regional spatial scales. Dispersal significantly affected diversity such that local and regional biotas at the low dispersal rate maintained the greatest number of species. The unimodal local dispersal-diversity relationship was predator-dependent, however, as selective press predation excluded species regardless of dispersal. Further, there was no effect of dispersal on beta diversity because predation generated local conditions that selected for distinct community assemblages. Spatial and temporal ecosystem stability responded to dispersal frequency but not predation. Low dispersal destabilized the spatial stability of producer biomass but stabilized temporal ecosystem productivity. The results indicate that selective predation can prevent species augmentation from mass effects but has no apparent influence on stability. Dispersal rates, in contrast, can have significant effects on both species diversity and ecosystem stability at multiple spatial scales in metacommunities.},

abstract = {Trophic cascades, in which changes in predation affect the biomass of lower trophic levels, vary substantially in strength and incidence. Most work to explain this variation has focused on local factors and has ignored larger regional effects. To study how metacommunity dynamics can alter trophic cascades, we constructed mesocosm metacommunities consisting of three pond communities with heterogeneous levels of fish predation and examined how planktonic dispersal rate (5-140{\%} per week) affected biomass partitioning. Two of the three communities differed continually in the occurrence of fish and supported different but constant environments in a 'spatial trophic cascade,' while the third community supported temporally variable fish occurrence in a 'temporal trophic cascade.' We find that the presence, but the not the magnitude, of dispersal dampens temporal trophic cascades through an increase in grazer biomass. In contrast, dispersal has no effect on the strength of spatial cascades due to strong sorting pressures in the communities with constant presence or absence of fish as top predators.},

abstract = {Environmental and biotic factors regulate species abundance and the composition of ecological communities. However, it is difficult to demonstrate principles of community assembly in nature due to observational limitations and historical effects. Numerical simulation can be used to evaluate whether hypothesized mechanisms produce a pattern seen in natural communities. Most models of many-species communities assume similar behavior by all individuals in a population. Here we describe an agent-based model of many-species communities in which interactions among individual agents are subjected to Darwinian selection (Holland's Echo model). To evaluate the response of the model to evolutionary mechanisms, we present a simple version of the model, and describe an experiment which evaluated community assembly patterns with and without selection for genome-mediated interactions, at various levels of invasion. Increased invasion rates decreased population size, but increased species richness and evenness. Interactions acted upon by natural selection resulted in greater population sizes and lower species richness and evenness than random interactions. Genotype abundances deviated from the expectation of equal abundances, and were affected by both the invasion rate and nature of inter-agent interactions. Species abundance patterns indicate that communities formed by random and selective interactions follow different assembly rules, and communities formed under high invasion rates showed no coherent community-level pattern of genotype abundances. Thus, both invasion rate and type of interspecific interaction regulate the assembly of species into communities.},

abstract = {Theories of island biogeography and of relative species abundance are of central importance in biogeography and community ecology, yet these two bodies of theory heretofore have been largely unconnected. Incorporating speciation into the theory of island biogeography unexpectedly results in unification of these two theories. The unified theory predicts the existence of a fundamental biodiversity number {\&}{\#}47 that controls not only species richness, but also relative species abundance in the source area metacommunity at equilibrium between speciation and extinction. With additional parameters for island size and migration rate, the theory also predicts relative species abundance on islands or local regions of continuous landscapes. Application of the theory to the biogeography and biodiversity of communities of tropical trees and reef-building corals are discussed. One important result is that only relatively modest migration rates are sufficient to dynamically couple the regional metacommunity and stabilize community structure on large spatiotemporal scales. Thus, regional, long-term compositional stasis in tropical rain forests and coral reefs can arise just as easily from the stabilizing effect of large numbers as from niche-assembly rules that limit species membership in communities. Because of the higher intrinsic vagility of corals, the theory predicts greater regional similarity in coral reef communities than in tropical tree communities.},

This hypothesis was tested in more than 1200 gaps in a tropical forest in Panama over a 13-year period. Gaps increased seedling establishment and sapling densities, but this effect was nonspecific and broad-spectrum, and species richness per stem was identical in gaps and in nongap control sites. Spatial and temporal variation in the gap disturbance regime did not explain variation in species richness. The species composition of gaps was unpredictable even for pioneer tree species. Strong recruitment limitation appears to decouple the gap disturbance regime from control of tree diversity in this tropical forest.},

abstract = {Since the publication of the unified neutral theory in 2001, there has been much discussion of the theory, pro and con. The hypothesis of ecological equivalence is the fundamental yet controversial idea behind neutral theory. Assuming trophically similar species are demographically alike (symmetric) on a per capita basis is only an approximation, but it is equivalent to asking: How many of the patterns of ecological communities are the result of species similarities, rather than of species differences? The strategy behind neutral theory is to see how far one can get with the simplification of assuming ecological equivalence before introducing more complexity. In another paper, I review the empirical evidence that led me to hypothesize ecological equivalence among many of the tree species in the species-rich tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI). In this paper, I develop a simple model for the evolution of ecological equivalence or niche convergence, using as an example evolution of the suite of life history traits characteristic of shade tolerant tropical tree species. Although the model is simple, the conclusions from it seem likely to be robust. I conclude that ecological equivalence for resource use are likely to evolve easily and often, especially in species-rich communities that are dispersal and recruitment limited. In the case of the BCI forest, tree species are strongly dispersal- and recruitment-limited, not only because of restricted seed dispersal, but also because of low recruitment success due to heavy losses of the seedling stages to predators and pathogens and other abiotic stresses such as drought. These factors and the high species richness of the community strongly reduce the potential for competitive exclusion of functionally equivalent or nearly equivalent species.},

Three integrative frameworks have been proposed, involving neutral dynamics, niche theory, and life history trade-offs respectively. Here, we review these frameworks of metacommunity theory to emphasise that: (1) studies on speciation and community ecology have converged towards similar general principles by acknowledging the central role of dispersal in metacommunities dynamics, (2) considering the conditions of emergence and maintenance of new species in communities has given rise to new models of speciation embedded in the metacommunity theory, (3) studies of diversification have shifted from relating phylogenetic patterns to landscapes spatial and ecological characteristics towards integrative approaches that explicitly consider speciation in a mechanistic ecological framework. We highlight several challenges, in particular the need for a better integration of the eco-evolutionary consequences of dispersal and the need to increase our understanding on the relative rates of evolutionary and ecological changes in communities.},

Previous models have shown that the form of this relationship depends on the relative rates of colonization and extinction and the sensitivity of these rates to competition. We use simple models to show that the LSR-RSR relationship also depends on the type of metacommunity structure (Levins-like or mainland-island), and our models generate a wider range of realistic forms than do most previous models. We parameterize and test our models with two independent data sets for Daphnia in rock pools on islands in Finland and Sweden. We find that the Levins-like model with competition correctly predicts the observed LSR-RSR relationship and provides the best fit to the average local species richness per island. Simulations show that our models are robust to relaxing our assumption of identical species properties. Our study is one of the first to make and successfully test quantitative predictions for how a widely studied community pattern, the LSR-RSR relationship, arises from metacommunity dynamics.},

abstract = {According to recent competition theory, the population dynamics of phytoplankton species in monoculture can be used to make a priori predictions of the dynamics and outcome of competition for light. The species with lowest "critical light intensity" should be the superior light competitor. To test this theory, we ran monoculture experiments and competition experiments with two green algae (Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus protuberans) and two cyanobacteria (Aphanizomenon fios-aquae and a Microcystis strain) in light-limited continuous cultures. We used the monoculture experiments to estimate the critical light intensities of the species. Scenedesmus had by far the highest critical light intensity. The critical light intensities of Chlorella, Aphanizomenon, and Microcystis were rather similar. According to observation, Aphanizomenon had a slightly lower critical light intensity than Chlorella and Microcystis. However, according to a model fit to the monoculture experiments, Chlorella had a slightly lower critical light intensity than Microcystis, which in turn had a slightly lower critical light intensity than Aphanizomenon. These subtle differences between observed and fitted critical light intensities could be attributed to differences in the light absorption spectra of the species. The competition experiments were all consistent with the competitive ordering of the species according to the fitted critical light intensities: Chlorella displaced all three other species, Microcystis displaced both Aphanizomenon and Scenedesmus, and Aphanizomenon only displaced Scenedesmus. Not only the final outcomes, but also the time courses of competition predicted by the theory, were in excellent agreement with the experimental results for nearly all species combinations.},

abstract = {Ecological theory that is grounded in metabolic currencies and constraints offers the potential to link ecological outcomes to biophysical processes across multiple scales of organization. The metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) has emphasized the potential for metabolism to serve as a unified theory of ecology, while focusing primarily on the size and temperature dependence of whole-organism metabolic rates. Generalizing metabolic ecology requires extending beyond prediction and application of standardized metabolic rates to theory focused on how energy moves through ecological systems. A bibliometric and network analysis of recent metabolic ecology literature reveals a research network characterized by major clusters focused on MTE, foraging theory, bioenergetics, trophic status, and generalized patterns and predictions. This generalized research network, which we refer to as metabolic ecology, can be considered to include the scaling, temperature and stoichiometric models forming the core of MTE, as well as bioenergetic equations, foraging theory, life-history allocation models, consumer-resource equations, food web theory and energy-based macroecology models that are frequently employed in ecological literature. We conclude with six points we believe to be important to the advancement and integration of metabolic ecology, including nomination of a second fundamental equation, complementary to the first fundamental equation offered by the MTE.},

abstract = {Bacteria grow and transform elements at different rates, and as yet, quantifying this variation in the environment is difficult. Determining isotope enrichment with fine taxonomic resolution after exposure to isotope tracers could help, but there are few suitable techniques.Wepropose a modification to stable isotope probing (SIP) that enables the isotopic composition ofDNA from individual bacterial taxa after exposure to isotope tracers to be determined. In our modification, after isopycnic centrifuga- tion,DNAis collected in multiple density fractions, and each fraction is sequenced separately. Taxon-specific density curves are produced for labeled and nonlabeled treatments, from which the shift in density for each individual taxon in response to isotope labeling is calculated. Expressing each taxon's density shift relative to that taxon's density measured without isotope enrichment accounts for the influence of nucleic acid composition on density and isolates the influence of isotope tracer assimilation. The shift in density translates quantitatively to isotopic enrichment. Because this revision to SIP allows quantitative measurements of isotope enrichment, we propose to call it quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP).Wedemonstrated qSIP using soil incuba- tions, in which soil bacteria exhibited strong taxonomic variations in 18Oand 13C composition after exposure to [18O]water or [13C]glucose. The addition of glucose increased the assimilation of 18OintoDNAfrom [18O]water. However, the increase in 18O assimilation was greater than expected based on utilization of glucose-derived carbon alone, because the addition of glucose in- directly stimulated bacteria to utilize other substrates for growth. This example illustrates the benefit of a quantitative approach to stable isotope probing. T},

In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error terminappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experi- mental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27{\%} of them, or 48{\%} of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudo- replication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict random- ization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre-layout (or conventional) and layout-specifit alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological j oumals as to how ecologists' under- standing of experimental design and statistics might be improved. Key},

abstract = {A new hypothesis, based on differences in the rates at which populations of competing species approach competitive equilibrium (reduction or exclusion of some species), is proposed to explain patterns of species diversity. The hypothesis assumes that most communities exist in a state of nonequilibrium where competitive equilibrium is prevented by periodic population reductions and environmental fluctuations. When competitive equilibrium is prevented, a dynamic balance may be established between the rate of competitive displacement and the frequency of population reduction, which results in a stable level of diversity. Under conditions of infrequent reductions, an increase in the population growth rates of competitors generally results in decreased diversity. This model clarifies an underlying pattern of variation in diversity and points out the common elements of previous hypotheses. Rather than arguing that either competition, predation, or productivity control diversity, it demonstrates that all of these may contribute to the same basic mechanism. In doing so, it not only explains the correlations of the other hypotheses with patterns of diversity, but also explains the exceptions that these hypotheses could not explain. This hypothesis may be applied to variations of diversity both on a latitudinal gradient and within specific regions.},

The effects of local processes, such as competition, can only be detected at appropriately small local scales, and are obscured by large samples that aggregate environmental heterogeneity. Relatively few ecological and evolutionary processes can be identified as uniquely regional in scale, and local processes are expected to produce regional-scale differences between regions that differ consistently in environmental conditions that affect local processes.

While these hypotheses have generated numerous reviews and meta-analyses, as well as persistent criticism, two prominent papers have recently concluded that both of these hypotheses should be abandoned because of theoretical weaknesses and failure to predict observed diversity patterns. I review these criticisms in the context of the continuing tension between logic and empiricism in the development of ecological theory, and conclude that most of the criticisms are misguided because they fail to recognize the inherent connections between these two hypotheses, and consequently fail to test them appropriately.

abstract = {The distribution of the diversity and abundance of life on Earth is thought to be shaped by the patterns of plant growth (net primary production, NPP) in the oceans and on land. The well-known latitudinal gradient of species diversity reaches its maximum in tropical rain forests, which are considered to be the most productive ecosystems on the planet. However, this high tropical productivity on land is the opposite of the well-documented distribution of marine productivity, which is greatest in the high-latitude oceans around the poles. This paradox can be resolved by a reevaluation of the terrestrial productivity gradient. Compilations of direct measurements of forest NPP show that annual NPP in tropical forests is no different than annual NPP in temperate forests, contrary to recent syntheses and to the output of global vegetation models. Other properties of forest ecosystems, such as basal area of trees, wood density, and the ratio of wood to leaf production, as well as animal properties such as body size, population density, and reproductive rates, support the conclusion that ecologically relevant terrestrial productivity is actually highest in the temperate latitudes, reaching a maximum between 308 and 508 before declining toward the poles. This ‘‘reversal'' of the latitudinal productivity gradient, if substantiated by a systematic global sampling effort, will necessitate a major reevaluation of ecological and evolutionary theory, as well as conservation strategies and international development policies.},

We show that, as in the case of reaction-diffusion models, for fixed spread slower rates of diffusion are always optimal. However, fixing the dispersal rate and varying the spread while assuming a constant cost of dispersal leads to more complicated results.

These models neglect spatial arrangement. 3. Cellular automata were developed to test the effect of population size on competitive coexistence of two species, given that the inferior competitor is a better colonizer. The cellular automata in the present study were stochastic in that they were based upon colonization and extinction probabilities rather than deterministic rules. 4. The effect of population size on competitive exclusion at the local scale was found to have little consequence for the coexistence of competitors at the metapopulation (or landscape) scale. In contrast, population size effects on extinction at the local scale led to much reduced landscape scale coexistence compared to simulations not including localized population size effects on extinction, especially in the cellular automata models. Spatially explicit dynamics of the cellular automata vs, deterministic rates of the numerical model resulted in decreased survival of both species. One important finding is that superior competitors that are widespread can become extinct before less common inferior competitors because of limited colonization. 5. These results suggest that population size-extinction relationships may play a large role in competitive coexistence. These results and differences are used in a model structure to help reconcile previous spatially explicit studies which provided apparently different results concerning coexistence of competing species.},

abstract = {In nature, fluxes across habitats often bring both nutrient and energetic resources into areas of low productivity from areas of higher productivity. These inputs can alter consumption rates of consumer and predator species in the recipient food webs, thereby influencing food web stability. Starting from a well-studied tritrophic food chain model, we investigated the impact of allochthonous inputs on the stability of a simple food web model. We considered the effects of allochthonous inputs on stability of the model using four sets of biologically plausible parameters that represent different dynamical outcomes. We found that low levels of allochthonous inputs stabilize food web dynamics when species preferentially feed on the autochthonous sources, while either increasing the input level or changing the feeding preference to favor allochthonous inputs, or both, led to a decoupling of the food chain that could result in the loss of one or all species. We argue that allochthonous inputs are important sources of productivity in many food webs and their influence needs to be studied further. This is especially important in the various systems, such as caves, headwater streams, and some small marine islands, in which more energy enters the food web from allochthonous inputs than from autochthonous inputs.},

abstract = {Water utilities in parts of the U.S. control microbial regrowth in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) by alternating postdisinfection methods between chlorination and chloramination. To examine how this strategy influences drinking water microbial communities, an urban DWDS (population ≅ 40,000) with groundwater as the source water was studied for approximately 2 years. Water samples were collected at five locations in the network at different seasons and analyzed for their chemical and physical characteristics and for their microbial community composition and structure by examining the 16S rRNA gene via terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA pyrosequencing technology. Nonmetric multidimension scaling and canonical correspondence analysis of microbial community profiles could explain {\textgreater}57{\%} of the variation. Clustering of samples based on disinfection types (free chlorine versus combined chlorine) and sampling time was observed to correlate to the shifts in microbial communities. Sampling location and water age ({\textless}21.2 h) had no apparent effects on the microbial compositions of samples from most time points. Microbial community analysis revealed that among major core populations, Cyanobacteria, Methylobacteriaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, and Xanthomonadaceae were more abundant in chlorinated water, and Methylophilaceae, Methylococcaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae were more abundant in chloraminated water. No correlation was observed with minor populations that were detected frequently ({\textless}0.1{\%} of total pyrosequences), which were likely present in source water and survived through the treatment process. Transient microbial populations including Flavobacteriaceae and Clostridiaceae were also observed. Overall, reversible shifts in microbial communities were especially pronounced with chloramination, suggesting stronger selection of microbial populations from chloramines than chlorine.},

abstract = {Urban ecological networks are defined differently in ecology, urban planning and landscape ecology, but they all have linearity and linkage in common. Early urban representations evolved from the constraints of deep ecological structure in the landscape to built elements that must work around natural linear obstacles-rivers, coastlines, dunes, cliffs, hills and valley swamps. Village commons were linked by roads. The Industrial Revolution led to accelerating urban growth, where the role of open space focussed on public health and transport. The Renaissance, Baroque and Picturesque movements accentuated networks in wooded parks, boulevards and sweeping riverine vistas. These provided a new aesthetic and sense of grandeur in the urban centres of European empires and later their colonies. Grafted onto this visual connectivity has been an awakened ecological understanding of spatial dynamics. The emergent notion of ecological corridor functionality provided support for green linear features, although initially this was based on untested theory. The idea of organisms moving along green highways seemed logical, but only recently has unequivocal empirical evidence emerged that demonstrates this functionality. Nevertheless, the main role of corridors may be to provide habitat rather than to act as connectors of nodal habitats. Most organisms can utilise stepping stones, and these may accommodate desired meta-populations while deterring pest movement. Swale drains and treatment wetlands provide riparian services and serve as biodiversity corridors. However, to most people the obvious function is visual-providing green fingers through what would otherwise be urban grey. The health benefits of these are have been demonstrated to be psychological as much as biophysical.},

abstract = {Streams and rivers host a significant portion of Earth's biodiversity and pro-vide important ecosystem services for human populations. Accurate information regarding the status and trends of stream resources is vital for their effective conser-vation and management. Most statistical techniques applied to data measured on stream networks were developed for terrestrial applications and are not optimized for streams. A new class of spatial statistical model, based on valid covariance structures for stream networks, can be used with many common types of stream data (e.g., water quality attributes, habitat conditions, biological surveys) through application of appropriate distributions (e.g., Gaussian, binomial, Poisson). The spatial statistical network models account for spatial autocorrelation (i.e., nonin-dependence) among measurements, which allows their application to databases with clustered measurement locations. Large amounts of stream data exist in many areas where spatial statistical analyses could be used to develop novel insights, improve predictions at unsampled sites, and aid in the design of efficient monitor-ing strategies at relatively low cost. We review the topic of spatial autocorrelation and its effects on statistical inference, demonstrate the use of spatial statistics with stream datasets relevant to common research and management questions, and discuss additional applications and development potential for spatial statistics on stream networks. Free software for implementing the spatial statistical network models has been developed that enables custom applications with many stream databases.},

We used experimental species mixtures of grassland plants to test this hypothesis and identified the mechanisms involved. Additionally, we tested whether biodiversity, productivity and temporal stability were similarly influenced by particular types of species interactions. We found that productivity was less variable among years in plots planted with more species. Temporal stability did not depend on whether the species were planted equally abundant (high evenness) or not (realistically low evenness). Greater richness increased temporal stability by increasing overyielding, asynchrony of species fluctuations and statistical averaging. Species interactions that favoured unproductive species increased both biodiversity and temporal stability. Species interactions that resulted in niche partitioning or facilitation increased both productivity and temporal stability. Thus, species interactions can promote biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Biodiversity is rapidly declining worldwide, and there is consensus that this can decrease ecosystem functioning and services. It remains unclear, though, whether few or many of the species in an ecosystem are needed to sustain the provisioning of ecosystem services. It has been hypothesized that most species would promote ecosystem services if many times, places, functions and environmental changes were considered; however, no previous study has considered all of these factors together. Here we show that 84{\%} of the 147 grassland plant species studied in 17 biodiversity experiments promoted ecosystem functioning at least once. Different species promoted ecosystem functioning during different years, at different places, for different functions and under different environmental change scenarios. Furthermore, the species needed to provide one function during multiple years were not the same as those needed to provide multiple functions within one year. Our results indicate that even more species will be needed to maintain ecosystem functioning and services than previously suggested by studies that have either (1) considered only the number of species needed to promote one function under one set of environmental conditions, or (2) separately considered the importance of biodiversity for providing ecosystem functioning across multiple years, places, functions or environmental change scenarios. Therefore, although species may appear functionally redundant when one function is considered under one set of environmental conditions, many species are needed to maintain multiple functions at multiple times and places in a changing world.},

abstract = {Natural ecological communities are continuously buffeted by a varying environment, often making it difficult to measure the stability of communities using concepts requiring the existence of an equilibrium point. Instead of an equilibrium point, the equilibrial state of communities subject to environmental stochasticity is a stationary distribution, which is characterized by means, variances, and other statistical moments. Here, we derive three properties of stochastic multispecies communities that measure different characteristics associated with community stability. These properties can be estimated from multispecies time-series data using first-order multivariate autoregressive (MAk(1)) models. We demonstrate how to estimate the parameters of MAR(1) models and obtain confidence intervals for both parameters and the measures of stability. We also address the problem of estimation when there is observation (measurement) error. To illustrate these methods, we compare the stability of the planktonic communities in three lakes in which nutrient loading and planktivorous fish abundance were experimentally manipulated. MAR(1) models and the statistical methods we present can be used to identify dynamically important interactions between species and to test hypotheses about stability and other dynamical properties of naturally varying ecological communities. Thus, they can be used to integrate theoretical and empirical studies of community dynamics.},

abstract = {Using both numerical simulations and analytical methods, we investigate how the stability of ecological communities depends on the number of species they contain. To investigate complex communities, we construct communities from modular "subcommunities" that can have arbitrary community structure; e.g. subcommunities could consist of pairs of predator and prey species, trios of prey, specialist predator and generalist predator, or any collection of interacting species. By building entire communities from subcommunities, we can change the number of species in the community without changing community structure. We further suppose that species sharing the same ecological role in different subcommunities act additively on the per capita population growth rates of other species. Under these assumptions, the interactions between species from different subcommunities have no effect on community-level stability, measured by the variability in the combined densities of species sharing the same ecological role in different subcommunities. Furthermore, increasing species richness (i.e. the number of subcommunities comprising the community) increases community-level stability only when it introduces species that respond differently to environmental fluctuations. Therefore, our results support the "insurance hypothesis" that species richness increases community-level stability by insuring that some species in a community are tolerant of different environmental fluctuations},

abstract = {Atkinson {\&} Shorrocks (1981) have studied a model for two species compet- ing for use of a patchy and ephemeral resource, and have shown that coexistence can be much easier if the eggs or larvae of each species are distributed in a clumped way (rather than independently randomly) among patches; these authors presented numerical studies in which the competi- tion within and between species in anyone patch was of "contest" form. In this paper we do two things. First, we extend Atkinson {\&} Shorrocks' conclusion by giving analytic results both for "contest" and for the opposite extreme of "scramble" competition within patches; Atkinson {\&} Shorrocks' results are found to be very robust, with the essential features being largely unaffected by the detailed nature of the competition process. Second, we show more generally that any mechanism producing intraspecific aggrega- tion of eggs in a patchy environment is likely to promote coexistence of competing species. In particular, if each female produces a large number of eggs and thence larvae in a single, ephemeral patch (as many insects do), the model's requirement of intraspecific aggregation with no covari- ance between species will tend to be fulfilled. This basic theme-that patterns of aggregative behaviour within a patchy and ephemeral environ- ment may facilitate competitive coexistence-resonates with a lot of broadly similar recent work on the dynamics of predator-prey and para- site-host systems.},

abstract = {We examine evidence for the structuring of fish communities from stream and lake systems and the roles of biotic, abiotic, and spatial factors in determining the species composition. Piscivory by fish is a dominant factor in both stream and lake systems whereas evidence for the importance of competition appears less convincing. Within small streams or lakes, the impact of predation may exclude other species, thereby leading to mutually exclusive distributions and strong differences in community composition. Within a geographic region, abiotic effects frequently dictate the relative importance of piscivory, thereby indirectly influencing the composition of prey species present. The spatial scale of studies influences our perceived importance of biotic versus abiotic factors, with small-scale studies indicating a greater importance of competition and large-scale studies emphasizing abiotic controls. The scale of the individual sites considered is critical because smaller systems have higher variability and wider extremes of conditions than larger lakes and rivers. The stability of physical systems and degree of spatial connectivity contribute to increased diversity in both larger stream and larger lake systems. We identify challenges and needs that must be addressed both to advance the field of fish community ecology and to face the problems associated with human-induced changes.},

abstract = {1 The importance of dispersal for plant community structure is poorly understood. Previous studies have hypothesized that patterns in the distribution and genetic structure of riparian plant communities were caused by hydrochory, i.e. plant dispersal by water. We separated the relative contributions of propagules from hydrochory and other dispersal vectors by comparing colonization in pairs of plots, one subject to flooding and deposition of hydrochores and the other unflooded. 2 The number of colonizing individuals and the mortality rate of individuals per year did not differ significantly with flooding, but hydrochory increased the number of colonizing species per year and plot by 40-200{\%}. The pool of colonizing species was 36-58{\%} larger per year for flooded than for unflooded plots, indicating that hydrochory increased the diversity by facilitating long-distance dispersal. Hydrochory resulted in more diverse plant communities after 3 years of succession at both plot and reach scales, despite the fact that flooding caused plant mortality. 3 We found no evidence that dams reduce the abundance and diversity of water-dispersed propagules by acting as barriers for plant dispersal. The role of hydrochory for plant colonization was similar between a free-flowing and a regulated river, although in fragmented rivers propagule sources are likely to be more local (within-impoundment). 4 We conclude that plant dispersal by water, as well as fluvial disturbance, is important for enhancing species richness in riparian plant communities. As flowing water may carry buoyant seeds long distances, riparian plant communities may receive a comparatively large proportion of their seeds by long-distance dispersal.},

abstract = {Hydrologic connectivity between catchment upland and near stream areas is essential for the transmission of water, solutes, and nutrients to streams. However, our current understanding of the role of riparian zones in mediating landscape hydrologic connectivity and the catchment scale export of water and solutes is limited. We tested the relationship between the duration of hillslope-riparian-stream (HRS) hydrologic connectivity and the rate and degree of riparian shallow groundwater turnover along four HRS well transects within a set of nested mountain catchments (Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest, MT). Transect HRS water table connectivity ranged from 9 to 123 days during the annual snowmelt hydrograph. Hillslope water was always characterized by low specific conductance ({\&}{\#}8764;27 {\&}{\#}956;S cm{\&}{\#}8722;1). In transects with transient hillslope water tables, riparian groundwater specific conductance was elevated during base flow conditions ({\&}{\#}8764;127 {\&}{\#}956;S cm{\&}{\#}8722;1) but shifted toward hillslope signatures once a HRS groundwater connection was established. The degree of riparian groundwater turnover was proportional to the duration of HRS connectivity and inversely related to the riparian: hillslope area ratios (buffer ratio; r2 = 0.95). We applied this relationship to the stream network in seven subcatchments within the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest and compared their turnover distributions to source water contributions measured at each catchment outlet. The amount of riparian groundwater exiting each of the seven catchments was linearly related (r2 = 0.92) to their median riparian turnover time. Our observations suggest that the size and spatial arrangement of hillslope and riparian zones along a stream network and the timing and duration of groundwater connectivity between them is a first-order control on the magnitude and timing of water and solutes observed at the catchment outlet.},

Various bacterial species reside in the kitchen, and refrigerators, the major means of food storage within kitchens, can be a direct source of food borne illness. Therefore, the monitoring of microbiota in the refrigerator is important for food safety. We investigated and compared bacterial communities that reside in the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator and on the seat of the toilet, which is recognized as highly colonized by microorganisms, in ten houses using high-throughput sequencing. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were predominant in refrigerator and toilet samples. However, Proteobacteria was more abundant in the refrigerator, and Firmicutes was more abundant in the toilet. These household bacterial communities were compared with those of human skin and gut to identify potential sources of household bacteria. Bacterial communities from refrigerators and toilets shared more species in common with human skin than gut. Opportunistic pathogens, including Propionibacterium acnes, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, were identified as species shared with human skin and gut microbiota. This approach can provide a general background of the household microbiota and a potential method of source-tracking for public health purposes.},

abstract = {Abstract The oscillatory tendency of consumer-resource interactions is a key determinant of food-web persistence. Here, we develop a metric for quantifying oscillatory tendency that scales the positive feedback effects of saturating functional responses with the negative feedback effects of self-limitation. We use this metric to predict the oscillatory tendency of a pairwise interaction, tritrophic chain, and tritrophic web. This framework yields two key predictions. First, the oscillatory tendency of any food web increases with the number of trophic links with long handling times regardless of the magnitude of attack rates. Attack rates influence oscillatory tendency only when handling times are short. Second, the realized oscillatory tendency of a trophic link depends on how the product of the attack rate and handling time scales with the strength of self-limitation. Importantly, our metric allows calculations of the critical self-limitation strength at which a consumer-resource interaction moves from stable to oscillatory dynamics. Our data analysis reveals that the majority (77{\%}) of interactions involve low attack rates and handling times, requiring only a modest level of self-limitation to suppress oscillations. Only 23{\%} of the interactions exhibit a strong oscillatory tendency, consistent with previous findings, based on time-series data, that 30{\%} of consumer-resource interactions in nature exhibit oscillations.},

abstract = {1. In the mid-1970s, Hynes (1975) wrote eloquently about the complex interactions between aquatic and terrestrial systems. Central theories in stream ecology developed thereafter have dealt with the longitudinal flow of energy, materials and organisms in streams, and, with the exception of the flood pulse concept (Junk, Bayley {\&} Sparks, 1989), have largely ignored areas outside the riparian zone. The structure of the upland and activities occurring there play a more important part than previously recognized in regulating community structure and ecosystem processes in streams.; ; 2. These new perspectives are made possible by developments in hierarchy theory, patch dynamics, and the refinement of tools used to quantify spatial and temporal heterogeneity.; ; 3. Geographical information systems (GIS), image processing technology and spatial statistical techniques allow quantitative assessment of lateral, longitudinal and vertical components of the landscape that interact at several spatial and temporal scales to influence streasm. When GIS is used in concert with geostatistics, multivariate statistics, or landscape models, complex relationships can be elucidated and predicted.; ; 4. To a certain extent, the tools discussed above have only automated functions that were previously performed manually. This suite of tools has improved the ability of aquatic ecologists to examine relationships and test theories over larger, more heterogeneus regions than were previously possible.; ; 5. At he local, state and federal level, management and regulatory frameworks are currently being re-evaluated to incorporate this new pespective in resource management and policy decision making.; ; 6. We will discuss and future trends in technologies and tools used for aquatic ecosystem research, and the use of techniques as they are applied in these regional assessments are also discussed.},

abstract = {Habitats may have dynamics that exist independently of the population densities of species occupying the habitat. For example, ephemeral habitat patches may disappear regardless of whether a particular species is present or not. Such habitat dynamics are frequently modelled by ignoring age-related variation in patch turnover rates. This can be thought of as a temporally implicit approach. An alternative, temporally explicit approach involves using age-structured models in order to describe variations in habitat dynamics. Simple models of coexistence between competing species show that temporally implicit models may be misleading where there is age-related variation in patch dynamics. Changing the shape of the patch survivorship function but not the average patch survivorship can result in mutual extinction, monocultures or coexistence of an inferior and a superior competitor. An explicit treatment of habitat demography may therefore offer improved predictive models and alternative landscape management strategies.},

abstract = {Mycorrhizal symbioses link the biosphere with the lithosphere by mediating nutrient cycles and energy flow though terrestrial ecosystems. A more mechanistic understanding of these plant-fungal associations may help ameliorate anthropogenic changes to C and N cycles and biotic communities. We explore three interacting principles: (1) optimal allocation, (2) biotic context and (3) fungal adaptability that may help predict mycorrhizal responses to carbon dioxide enrichment, nitrogen eutrophication, invasive species and land-use changes. Plant-microbial feedbacks and thresholds are discussed in light of these principles with the goal of generating testable hypotheses. Ideas to develop large-scale collaborative research efforts are presented. It is our hope that mycorrhizal symbioses can be effectively integrated into global change models and eventually their ecology will be understood well enough so that they can be managed to help offset some of the detrimental effects of anthropogenic environmental change.},

Threats as diverse as Ebola virus, human malaria, and bat white-nose syndrome illustrate the need for a mechanistic understanding of the ecological interactions underlying emerging infections. We describe how recent advances in community ecology can be adopted to address contemporary challenges in disease research. These analytical tools can identify the factors governing complex assemblages of multiple hosts, parasites, and vectors, and reveal how processes link across scales from individual hosts to regions. They can also determine the drivers of heterogeneities among individuals, species, and regions to aid targeting of control strategies. We provide examples where these principles have enhanced disease management and illustrate how they can be further extended.},

abstract = {Large ¯oods can have major impacts on riparian forests. Here we examine the variability and spatial distribution of riparian forest responses along eight third-to {\textregistered}fth-order streams following a large ¯ood ({\$} 100 year recurrence interval) in the Cascade Mountain Range of Oregon. We categorized disturbance intensity (physical force) exerted on riparian trees during ¯oods into three classes: (i) purely ¯uvial (high water ¯ow only); (ii) ¯uvial supplemented by dispersed pieces of ¯oating wood (uncongested wood transport); (iii) ¯uvial with movement of batches of wood (congested wood transport). These types of material transport and associated classes of disturbance intensity resulted in a gradient of biotic responses of disturbance severity ranging from standing riparian trees inundated by high water, to trees toppled but still partially rooted, to complete removal of trees. High within-stream and among-stream responses were in¯uenced by pre-¯ood stream and riparian conditions as well as ¯ood dynamics, especially the availability of individual pieces or congested batches of wood. Fluvial disturbance alone toppled fewer riparian trees than in reaches where ¯oodwaters transported substantial amounts of wood. Debris ¯ows delivered additional wood and sediment to parts of reaches of four of these study streams; riparian trees were removed and toppled for up to 1{\'{A}}5 km downstream of the debris ¯ow tributary channel. Congested wood transport resulted in higher frequency of toppled trees and greater deposition of new wood levees along channel margins. The condition of the landscape at the time of a major ¯ood strongly in¯uenced responses of riparian forests. Recent and historic land-use practices, as well as the time since the previous large ¯ood, in¯uenced not only the structure and age of the riparian forests, but also the availability of agents of disturbance, such as large pieces of ¯oating wood, that contribute to disturbance of riparian forests during ¯oods.},

Dispersal may occur before or after reproduction, a feature ignored in models analysing the eveolution of dispersal. Using a simulation model, we examine how the temporal order of reproduction and dispersal within the life cycle affects the competition of genotypes with different dispersal strategies. We found that the evolutionary outcome in time-discrete models depends significantly on the temporal order of dispersal and reproduction, provided that: (i) density-dependent dispersal strategies are involved into competition, and (ii) the environment is temporally variable. Our results suggest that selection can act in different directions, depending on the relative timing of dispersal, reproduction and environmental fluctuations in the life cycle.},

Here we develop a high-quality reference genome assembly for threespine sticklebacks. By sequencing the genomes of twenty additional individuals from a global set of marine and freshwater populations, we identify a genome-wide set of loci that are consistently associated with marine-freshwater divergence. Our results indicate that reuse of globally shared standing genetic variation, including chromosomal inversions, has an important role in repeated evolution of distinct marine and freshwater sticklebacks, and in the maintenance of divergent ecotypes during early stages of reproductive isolation. Both coding and regulatory changes occur in the set of loci underlying marine-freshwater evolution, but regulatory changes appear to predominate in this well known example of repeated adaptive evolution in nature.},

abstract = {1. Experimental manipulations were performed to determine the biological, chemical and physical attributes that govern sediment respiration in the hyporheic zone of Sycamore Creek, a Sonoran Desert stream. 2. Hyporheic respiration per unit volume of sediment was inversely related to diameter of sediment particles, indicating that respiration is affected by availability of substrate for microbial colonization (i.e. sediment surfaces). Respiration rate per unit surface area on sediments was positively correlated with particle diameter, indicating greater metabolic activity of microbes on larger sediments. 3. Hyporheic respiration was more than twice as high in water collected from the surface flow than from subsurface flow. Further, hyporheic respiration was highest immediately following exposure of sediments to surface water and declined over time, presumably due to exhaustion of labile organic matter. 4. Microbial activity was stimulated by addition of algal leachate; however, amendments of leaf leachate had little effect. Respiration was also elevated with dextrose and leucine amendments, but not with inorganic nitrogen additions, indicating hyporheic respiration is carbon limited. 5. Water from the stream surface is probably enriched in labile organic matter derived from algae and stimulates respiration at points of hydrologic downwelling where surface water enters hyporheic sediments. The physical structure of sediments further affects metabolism by affecting the area available for microbial attachment.},

abstract = {Methanogenesis was studied in five streams of central and southern Arizona by examining the distribution of methane in interstitial water and evasion of methane in three subsystems (hyporheic, parafluvial and bank sediments). In Sycamore Creek, the primary study site (studied during summer and early autumn), methane content of interstitial water exhibited a distinct spatial pattern. In hyporheic (sediments beneath the wetted channel) and parfluvial zones (active channel sediments lateral to the wetted channel), which were well oxygenated due to high hydrologic exchange with the surface stream and had little particulate organic matter (POM), interstitial methane concentration averaged only 0.03 mgCH4-C/L. Bank sediments (interface between the active channel and riparian zone), in contrast, which were typically vegetated, had high POM, low hydrologic exchange and concomitantly low dissolved oxygen levels, had interstitial concentration averaging 1.5 mgCH4-C/L. Methane emission from Sycamore Creek, similar to methane concentration, averaged only 3.7 mgCH4-C{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}d−1 from hyporheic and parafluvial zones as opposed to 170 mgCH4-C{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}d−1 from anoxic bank sediments. Methane in four additional streams sampled (one sampling date during late winter) was low and exhibited little spatial variation most likely due to cooler stream temperatures. Interstitial methane in parafluvial and bank sediments of all four streams ranged from only 0.005 to 0.1 mgCH4-C/L. Similarly methane evasion was also low from these streams varying from 0 to 5.7 mgCH4-C{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}d−1. The effects of organic matter and temperature on methanogenesis were further examined by experimentally manipulating POM and temperature in stoppered flasks filled with hyporheic sediments and stream water. Methane production significantly increased with all independent variables. Methane production is greatest in bank sediments that are relatively isolated hydrologically and lowest in hyporheic and parafluvial sediments that are interactive with the surface stream.},

abstract = {We study the qualitative properties of population cycles in a predator-prey system where genetic variability allows contemporary rapid evolution of the prey. Previous numerical studies have found that prey evolution in response to changing predation risk can have major quantitative and qualitative effects on predator-prey cycles, including: (1) large increases in cycle period, (2) changes in phase relations (so that predator and prey are cycling exactly out of phase, rather than the classical quarter-period phase lag), and (3) "cryptic" cycles in which total prey density remains nearly constant while predator density and prey traits cycle. Here we focus on a chemostat model motivated by our experimental system (Fussmann et al. in Science 290:1358-1360, 2000; Yoshida et al. in Proc roy Soc Lond B 424:303-306, 2003) with algae (prey) and rotifers (predators), in which the prey exhibit rapid evolution in their level of defense against predation. We show that the effects of rapid prey evolution are robust and general, and furthermore that they occur in a specific but biologically relevant region of parameter space: when traits that greatly reduce predation risk are relatively cheap (in terms of reductions in other fitness components), when there is coexistence between the two prey types and the predator, and when the interaction between predators and undefended prey alone would produce cycles. Because defense has been shown to be inexpensive, even cost-free, in a number of systems (Andersson et al. in Curr Opin Microbiol 2:489-493, 1999: Gagneux et al. in Science 312:1944-1946, 2006; Yoshida et al. in Proc Roy Soc Lond B 271:1947-1953, 2004), our discoveries may well be reproduced in other model systems, and in nature. Finally, some of our key results are extended to a general model in which functional forms for the predation rate and prey birth rate are not specified.},

abstract = {$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Metacommunity theory predicts that increasing patch size and patch connectivity can alter local species diversity by affecting either colonization rates, extinction rates or both. Although species' dispersal abilities or ‘dispersal mode' (e.g. gravity-, wind- or animal-dispersed seeds) can mediate the effects of patch size and connectivity on diversity, these important factors are frequently overlooked in empirical metacommunity work.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* We use a natural metacommunity of aspen stands within a grassland matrix to determine whether dispersal mode alters the influence of stand size and connectivity on understorey plant diversity. We sampled the same area in each patch, controlled for the presence of matrix species in aspen stands, and tested for the effects of size, connectivity and dispersal mode on metacommunity richness. Because dispersal groups responded differently to patch size and connectivity, we created a null model and assessed ungulate activity to explore whether competitive dynamics or herbivory were driving diversity patterns.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Animal-dispersed species and species with no dispersal aid had higher diversity per unit area in larger stands, likely because large stands can both support larger populations that are less prone to extinction and may also attract seed-dispersing animals such as birds and small mammals that are sensitive to edge effects. Consistent with other empirical work, we found a positive relationship between diversity and connectivity for wind-dispersed species. However, we detected a negative effect of stand connectivity on the diversity of species with no dispersal aid, possibly due to the presence of other highly competitive species groups dominating well-connected patches, as our null model results suggest. We found no evidence for higher ungulate activity in highly connected patches, suggesting that herbivory may not be driving the decline in diversity of plants with no dispersal aid.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Synthesis. Overall, we see a positive effect of stand area on diversity for most groups despite sampling equal area in all stands, which is a prediction of metacommunity theory that is normally overlooked. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering variation in the dispersal modes of focal species for explaining the diversity patterns of natural metacommunities.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Global change is altering the movement of materials across landscapes in ways that likely have major consequences for the functioning and stability of ecosystems. For example, the export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems is increasing globally. This "browning" phenomenon is expected to alter the stability of recipient aquatic ecosystems, but theory provides contrasting predictions about the form and direction of this response. In this study, we created a supply rate of terrestrial DOC by adding humic substances on weekly basis to ten experimental ponds (106 L each) over a growing season. The manipulation of terrestrial DOC supply had strong effects on the chemical, physical, and biological properties of the pond ecosystems. Light attenuation linearly increased with terrestrial DOC supply, which created a shading effect that negatively influenced whole-pond gross primary production and respiration. Despite this, bacterial contributions to basal energy mobilization and respiration increased with terrestrial DOC supply indicating that aquatic food webs were subsidized by terrestrial inputs. After establishing the DOC gradient, we used Dynamic Linear Models to test the subsidy-stability hypothesis by measuring the resilience and sensitivity of each pond to a pulse nutrient perturbation. We found that recovery from the perturbation decreased non-linearly along a gradient in terrestrial DOC supply. Reciprocal transplant experiments indicated that owing primarily to its light attenuating properties and recalcitrant nature, terrestrial DOC diminished aquatic ecosystem stability by reducing nutrient turnover rates (NTR). Together, our results demonstrate that global change-mediated alterations in the movement of material and energy between habitats can have unpredictable and dramatic impacts on the reliability of ecosystem services.},

The present paper includes habitat description, elevational range, substrate preference, and frequency estimates for more than 130 riparian mosses and liverworts found in old-growth Pseudotsuga-Tsuga forests of the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon. The data are based on 360 samples distributed among 42 sites covering Ist to 5th order streams and 420 to 1250 m. TWINSPAN analysis resulted in 6 sample groups, representing samples from different elevations, geomorphic surfaces, and stream sizes. The most common mosses are Eurhynchium oreganum, Isothecium stoloniferum, Hypnum circinale, and Dicranum fuscescens. Among the hepatics Scapania bolanderi, Cephalozia lunulifolia, and Porella navicularis are the most abundant species. Most species are rare at both site and sample plot level, and this is especially true for acrocarps where more than one-third of the observed species occurred in only one or two sites or/and samples. Four of the occurring species (i.e., Antitrichia curtipendula, Buxbaumia piperi, Douinia ovata, and Ptilidium californicum) are listed for special management and/or regional surveys.},

abstract = {A study was made of the food web formed from a protozoon, two bacteria, and a glucose minimal medium in chemostat culture. The system was also divided into simpler parts, first by omitting the protozoon to obtain a competition system, and then by omitting one or the other of the bacteria to obtain two food chains. In the competition studies, one bacterium was displaced by the other at all holding times used. In the food chain studies, sustained oscillations of the population densities of predator and prey developed at short holding times, and then changed to damped oscillations at longer holding times. In addition, the level of residual glucose remained high at long holding times. A new model of microbial growth is necessary to explain these results. In the food web studies, predation of the protozoon on the two bacteria stabilized the competition between the latter and allowed their coexistence in the same habitat. Thus, Gause's principle was circumvented.},

abstract = {Entropies such as the Shannon ? /Wiener and Gini /Simpson ? indices are not themselves diversities. Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, S{\o}rensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita -Horn index as special cases. What},

abstract = {To better understand how photo-oxidation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) affects microbial activ- ity and DOM processing along hydrological fl ow paths in an arctic catchment, we conducted experiments measur- ing responses in bacterial production (BP) to sunlight- exposed DOM from up-slope sources, including soil, stream, and lake water. Overall, sunlight exposure sig- nifi cantly reduced specifi c ultra-violet absorbance and dissolved organic carbon concentrations and increased phenolic concentrations; these changes were more pro- nounced in soil than in surface waters. Sunlight reduced BP in common inoculum bioassay experiments at short time scales (hours), but the magnitude of the effect dif- fered among DOM sources and was related to phenolic content; effects were more negative on DOM sources with high phenolic contents. In contrast, longer contact times (weeks) between bacteria and photo-oxidized soil, stream, and lake water DOM enhanced, did not change, and reduced BP, respectively. In these longer-term ex- periments, sunlight-exposed DOM had a greater positive effect on lake than stream BP, and caused shifts in bacte- rial community composition (based on denaturing gradi- ent gel electrophoresis of bacterial-specifi c 16S rDNA). Changes in bacterial community composition were great- er in response to sunlight-exposed DOM from soils than from the stream. Our fi ndings suggest that overall im- pacts of DOM photo-oxidation in aquatic environments depends on DOM source, and that contrasting effects of photo-oxidized DOM at varying time scales may be part- ly due to shifts in the bacterial community composition to groups better able to consume photo-products or toler- ate harmful radicals.},

Ordination analyses identified a number of factors that were correlated with the observed communities including host species as well as soil organic matter, nutrient and heavy metal enrichment. Overall, our application of the high throughput 454 sequencing provided an expedient means for characterization of fungal communities.},

Proportions of meadows and forests change with environmental conditions and disturbance history. We investigated the belowground microbial communities associated with these two vegetation types and how they change across the meadow-forest transition at two sites in Oregon. Soils were sampled along replicate transects extending from meadow into forest. We quantified total bacterial and fungal biomass using direct microscopy and described the composition of bacterial and fungal communities using a DNA-based fingerprinting technique. Bacterial biomass was similar in meadow and forest soils, but fungal biomass was significantly higher in forest soil. Meadow and forest soils had distinct communities of bacteria and fungi. Bacterial communities near the meadow-forest boundary reflected current vegetation, but fungal communities under meadow vegetation near the forest edge was intermediate in composition between those found in meadow and forest soils. The more gradual transition observed with fungal communities may reflect the influence of tree roots and their associated ectomycorrhizal fungi or possibly colonization by saprophytic fungi associated with tree litter accumulating near the forest adge. Invasion of forest-associated fungi into the meadow soils may presage subsequent expansion of forest vegetation into meadows.},

abstract = {We investigated if an increase in species pool size leads to more pronounced turnover in local communities and assessed if this increase relates to stronger competition for environmental niches or to more random placement of species. We compared compositional turnover of pteridophytes (ferns and lycophytes) at 15 sites in mountain ecosystems on 13 islands in southeast Asia and Melanesia that mainly differed in the size of their species pool. Each site was sampled with 16 plots of 20 ? 20 m2. Using multiple regression on distance matrices, we investigated the relationship between environmental distance and compositional turnover at different spatial extents within sites with different species pool sizes. Additionally, we tested the hypothesis that the intensity of competition increases with increasing species pool size. This was done by assessing how realized niche overlap and unevenness of communities relate to environmental distance and species pool size. With increasing species pool size, there was an increase in: a) proportional turnover in community composition, b) the importance of environmental distance for explaining turnover in community composition and c) a decrease in environmental niche overlap between species indicating an increasing importance of competition for community composi- tion. Our results support the idea that increasing species pool size increases the competition for available environmental niches, and thereby leads to a tighter connection between environmental factors and community composition.},

abstract = {Metacommunity research relies largely on proxies for inferring the effect of dispersal on local community structure. Overland and watercourse distances have been typically used as such proxies. A good proxy for dispersal should, however, take into account more complex landscape features that can affect an organism's movement and dispersal. The cost distance approach does just that, allowing determining the path of least resistance across a landscape. Here, we examined the distance decay of assemblage similarity within a subarctic stream insect metacommunity. We tested whether overland, watercourse and cumulative cost distances performed differently as correlates of dissimilarity in assemblage composition between sites. We also investigated the effect of body size and dispersal mode on metacommunity organization. We found that dissimilarities in assemblage composition correlated more strongly with environmental than physical distances between sites. Overland and watercourse distances showed similar correlations to assemblage dissimilarity between sites, being sometimes significantly correlated with biological variation of entire insect communities. In metacommunities deconstructed by body size or dispersal mode, contrary to our expectation, passive dispersers showed a slightly stronger correlation than active dispersers to environmental differences between sites, although passive dispersers also showed a stronger correlation than active dispersers to physical distances between sites. The strength of correlation between environmental distance and biological dissimilarity also varied slightly among the body size classes. After controlling for environmental differences between sites, cumulative cost distances were slightly better correlates of biological dissimilarities than overland or watercourse distances between sites. However, quantitative differences in correlation coefficients were small between different physical distances. Although environmental differences typically override physical distances as determinants of the composition of stream insect assemblages, correlations between environmental distances and biological dissimilarities are typically rather weak. This undetermined variation may be attributable to dispersal processes, which may be captured using better proxies for the process. We suggest that further modifying the measurement of cost distances may be a fruitful avenue, especially if complemented by more direct natural history information on insect dispersal behaviour and distances travelled by them.},

abstract = {[1] Hyporheic exchange flows were simulated using MODFLOW and MODPATH to estimate relative effects of channel morphologic features on the extent of the hyporheic zone, on hyporheic exchange flow, and on the residence time of stream water in the hyporheic zone. Four stream reaches were compared in order to examine the influence of stream size and channel constraint. Within stream reaches, the influence of pool-step or pool-riffle sequences, channel sinuosity, secondary channels, and channel splits was examined. Results showed that the way in which channel morphology controlled exchange flows differed with stream size and, in some cases, with channel constraint. Pool-step sequences drove hyporheic exchange in the second-order sites, creating exchange flows with relatively short residence times. Multiple features interacted to drive hyporheic exchange flow in the unconstrained fifth-order site, where pool-riffle sequences and a channel split created exchange flows with short residence times, whereas a secondary channel created exchange flows with long residence times. There was relatively little exchange flow in the bedrock-constrained fifth-order site. Groundwater flow models were effective in examining the morphologic features that controlled hyporheic exchange flow, and surface-visible channel morphologic features controlled the development of the hyporheic zone in these mountain streams.},

abstract = {Adaptive evolution, to a large extent, is a complex combinatorial optimization process. In this article we take beginning steps towards developing a general theory of adaptive "walks" via fitter variants in such optimization processes. We introduce the basic idea of a space of entities, each a 1-mutant neighbor of many other entities in the space, and the idea of a fitness ascribed to each entity. Adaptive walks proceed from an initial entity, via fitter neighbors, to locally or globally optimal entities that are fitter than their neighbors. We develop a general theory for the number of local optima, lengths of adaptive walks, and the number of alternative local optima accessible from any given initial entity, for the baseline case of an uncorrelated fitness landscape. Most fitness landscapes are correlated, however. Therefore we develop parts of a universal theory of adaptation on correlated landscapes by adaptive processes that have sufficient numbers of mutations per individual to "jump beyond" the correlation lengths in the underlying landscape. In addition, we explore the statistical character of adaptive walks in two independent complex combinatorial optimization problems, that of evolving a specific cell type in model genetic networks, and that of finding good solutions to the traveling salesman problem. Surprisingly, both show similar statistical features, encouraging the hope that a general theory for adaptive walks on correlated and uncorrelated landscapes can be found. In the final section we explore two limits to the efficacy of selection. The first is new, and surprising: for a wide class of systems, as the complexity of the entities under selection increases, the local optima that are attainable fall progressively closer to the mean properties of the underlying space of entities. This may imply that complex biological systems, such as genetic regulatory systems, are "close" to the mean properties of the ensemble of genomic regulatory systems explored by evolution. The second limit shows that with increasing complexity and a fixed mutation rate, selection often becomes unable to pull an adapting population to those local optima to which connected adaptive walks via fitter variants exist. These beginning steps in theory development are applied to maturation of the immune response, and to the problem of radiation and stasis. Despite the limitations of the adaptive landscape metaphor, we believe that further development along the lines begun here will prove useful.},

abstract = {Food webs provide a framework for integrating population dynamics, community structure and ecosystem processes, but the causes of many food-web patterns remain controversial1. An unresolved issue concerns the factors that limit food-chain length in natural ecosystems, although theory predicts that length could be limited by inefficient energy transfer between trophic levels2 orby the instability of longer food chains3. Experiments provide qualitative support for the instability of longer food chains4, but, according to theory, this relationship may depend on the assumptions used to model food chains5. Here we show that experimental manipulations of productivity determine the length of microbial food chains in laboratory microcosms. Food-chain length is also predicted to determine how productivity influences population densities within trophic levels. If trophic levels consist entirely ofedible prey, and if consumers feed only on the next-lower trophic level6, population densities should alternate between increasing and constant values as food-chain length increases (Fig. 1). We find that food-chain length determines population-level responses to productivity, which is consistent with predictions from models. These results indicate that the impacts of human alterations of productivity will depend crucially on the structure of the affected food chains.},

abstract = {We study the consequences of asymmetric dispersal rates (e.g., due to wind or current) for adaptive evolution in a system of two habitat patches. Asymmetric dispersal rates can lead to over- crowding of the “downstream” habitat, resulting in a source-sink population structure in the absence of intrinsic quality differences between habitats or can even cause an intrinsically better habitat to function as a sink. Source-sink population structure due to asym- metric dispersal rates has similar consequences for adaptive evolution as a source-sink structure due to habitat quality differences: natural selection tends to be biased toward the source habitat. We demon- strate this for two models of adaptive evolution: invasion of a rare allele that improves fitness in one habitat but reduces it in the other and antagonistic selection on a quantitative trait determined by five additive loci. If a habitat can sustain a population without immi- gration, the conditions for adaptation to that habitat are most fa- vorable if there is little or no immigration from the other habitat; the influence of emigration depends on the magnitude of the allelic effects involved and other parameters. If, however, the population is initially unable to persist in a given habitat without immigration, our model predicts that the population will be most likely to adapt to that habitat if the dispersal rates in both directions are high. Our results highlight the general message that the effect of gene flow upon local adaptation should depend profoundly on the demographic con- text of selection.},

abstract = {Natural populations live in heterogeneous environments, where habitat variation drives the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. The key feature of population structure addressed in this paper is the net flow of individuals from source (good) to sink (poor) habitats. These movements make it necessary to calculate fitness across the full range of habitats encountered by the population, rather than independently for each habitat. As a consequence, the optimal phenotype in a given habitat not only depends on conditions there but is linked to the performance of individuals in other habitats. We generalize the Euler-Lotka equation to define fitness in a spatially heterogeneous environment in which individuals disperse among habitats as newborn and then stay in a given habitat for life. In this case, maximizing fitness (the rate of increase over all habitats) is equivalent to maximizing the reproductive value of newborn in each habitat but not to maximizing the rate of increase that would result if individuals in each habitat were an isolated population. The new equation can be used to find optimal reaction norms for life history traits, and examples are calculated for age at maturity and clutch size. In contrast to previous results, the optimal reaction norm differs from the line connecting local adaptations of isolated populations each living in only one habitat. Selection pressure is higher in good and frequent habitats than in poor and rare ones. A formula for the relative importance of these two factors allows predictions of the habitat in which the genetic variance about the optimal reaction norm should be smallest.},

Urban ecology is an emerging discipline that seeks to understand these interactions, and one of the grand challenges for urban ecologists is to develop models that encompass the myriad influences of people on biogeochemistry. We suggest here that existing models, developed primarily in unmanaged and agricultural ecosystems, work poorly in urban ecosystems because they do not include human biogeochemical controls such as impervious surface proliferation, engineered aqueous flow paths, landscaping choices, and human demographic trends. Incorporating these human controls into biogeochemical models will advance urban ecology and will require enhanced collaborations with engineers and social scientists. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Urban ecosystems are expanding globally, and assessing the ecological consequences of urbanization is critical to understanding the biology of local and global change related to land use. We measured carbon (C) fluxes, nitrogen (N) cycling, and soil microbial community structure in a replicated (n=3) field experiment comparing urban lawns to corn, wheat-fallow, and unmanaged shortgrass steppe ecosystems in northern Colorado. The urban and corn sites were irrigated and fertilized. Wheat and shortgrass steppe sites were not fertilized or irrigated. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in urban ecosystems (383 +/- 11 C m(-2) yr(-1)) was four to five times greater than wheat or shortgrass steppe but significantly less than corn (537 +/- 44 C m(-2) yr(-1)). Soil respiration (2777 +/- 273 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and total belowground C allocation (2602 +/- 269 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) in urban ecosystems were both 2.5 to five times greater than any other land-use type. We estimate that for a large (1578 km(2)) portion of Larimer County, Colorado, urban lawns occupying 6.4{\%} of the land area account for up to 30{\%} of regional ANPP and 24{\%} of regional soil respiration from land-use types that we sampled. The rate of N cycling from urban lawn mower clippings to the soil surface was comparable with the rate of N export in harvested corn (both similar to 12-15 g N m(-2) yr(-1)). A one-time measurement of microbial community structure via phospholipid fatty acid analysis suggested that land-use type had a large impact on microbial biomass and a small impact on the relative abundance of broad taxonomic groups of microorganisms. Our data are consistent with several other studies suggesting that urbanization of arid and semiarid ecosystems leads to enhanced C cycling rates that alter regional C budgets.},

In this context, the environment functions like a filter (or sieve) removing all species lacking specified combinations of traits.

abstract = {The transmission of infectious diseases is an inherently ecological process involving interactions among at least two, and often many, species. Not surprisingly, then, the species diversity of ecological communities can potentially affect the prevalence of infectious diseases. Although a number of studies have now identified effects of diversity on disease prevalence, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear in many cases. Starting with simple epidemiological models, we describe a suite of mechanisms through which diversity could increase or decrease disease risk, and illustrate the potential applicability of these mechanisms for both vector-borne and non-vector-borne diseases, and for both specialist and generalist pathogens. We review examples of how these mechanisms may operate in specific disease systems. Because the effects of diversity on multi-host disease systems have been the subject of much recent research and controversy, we describe several recent efforts to delineate under what general conditions host diversity should increase or decrease disease prevalence, and illustrate these with examples. Both models and literature reviews suggest that high host diversity is more likely to decrease than increase disease risk. Reduced disease risk with increasing host diversity is especially likely when pathogen transmission is frequency-dependent, and when pathogen transmission is greater within species than between species, particularly when the most competent hosts are also relatively abundant and widespread. We conclude by identifying focal areas for future research, including (1) describing patterns of change in disease risk with changing diversity; (2) identifying the mechanisms responsible for observed changes in risk; (3) clarifying additional mechanisms in a wider range of epidemiological models; and (4) experimentally manipulating disease systems to assess the impact of proposed mechanisms.},

abstract = {Aggregate community-level response to disturbance is a principle concern in ecology because post-disturbance dynamics are integral to the ability of ecosystems to maintain function in an uncertain world. Community-level responses to disturbance can be arrayed along a spectrum ranging from synchronous oscillations where all species rise and fall together, to compensatory dynamics where total biomass remains relatively constant despite fluctuations in the densities of individual species. An important recent insight is that patterns of synchrony and compensation can vary with the timescale of analysis and that spectral time series methods can enable detection of coherent dynamics that would otherwise be obscured by opposing patterns occurring at different scales. Here I show that application of wavelet analysis to experimentally manipulated plankton communities reveals strong synchrony after disturbance. The result is paradoxical because it is well established that these communities contain both disturbance-sensitive and disturbance-tolerant species leading to compensation within functional groups. Theory predicts that compensatory substitution of functionally equivalent species should stabilize ecological communities, yet I found at the whole-community level a large increase in seasonal biomass variation. Resolution of the paradox hinges on patterns of seasonality among species. The compensatory shift in community composition after disturbance resulted in a loss of cold-season dominants, which before disturbance had served to stabilize biomass throughout the year. Species dominating the disturbed community peaked coherently during the warm season, explaining the observed synchrony and increase in seasonal biomass variation. These results suggest that theory relating compensatory dynamics to ecological stability needs to consider not only complementarity in species responses to environmental change, but also seasonal complementarity among disturbance-tolerant and disturbance-sensitive species.},

abstract = {Stream channel development in forested areas is profoundly influenced by large organic debris (logs, limbs and rootwads greater than 10 cm in diameter) in the channels.In low gradient meandering streams large organic debris enters the channel through bank erosion, mass wasting, blowdown, and collapse of trees due to ice loading. In small streams large organic debris may locally influence channel morphology and sediment transport processes because the stream may not have the competency to redistribute the debris. In larger streams flowing water may move large organic debris, concentrating it into distinct accumulations (debris jams). Organic debris may greatly affect channel form and process by: increasing or decreasing stability of stream banks; influencing development of midchannel bars and short braided reaches; and facilitating, with other favourable circumstances, development of meander cutoffs.In steep gradient mountain streams organic debris may enter the channel by all the processes mentioned for low gradient streams. In addition, considerable debris may also enter the channel by way of debris avalanches or debris torrents. In small to intermediate size mountain streams with steep valley walls and little or no floodplain or flat valley floor, the effects of large organic debris on the fluvial processes and channel form may be very significant. Debris jams may locally accelerate or retard channel bed and bank erosion and/or deposition; create sites for significant sediment storage; and produce a stepped channel profile, herein referred to as ?organic stepping?, which provides for variable channel morphology and flow conditions.The effect of live or dead trees anchored by rootwads into the stream bank may not only greatly retard bank erosion but also influence channel width and the development of small scour holes along the channel beneath tree roots. Once trees fall into the stream, their influence on the channel form and process may be quite different than when they were defending the banks, and, depending on the size of the debris, size of the stream, and many other factors, their effects range from insignificant to very important.},

abstract = {Buildings are complex ecosystems that house trillions of microorganisms interacting with each other, with humans and with their environment. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary processes that determine the diversity and composition of the built environment microbiome--the community of microorganisms that live indoors--is important for understanding the relationship between building design, biodiversity and human health. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to quantify relationships between building attributes and airborne bacterial communities at a health-care facility. We quantified airborne bacterial community structure and environmental conditions in patient rooms exposed to mechanical or window ventilation and in outdoor air. The phylogenetic diversity of airborne bacterial communities was lower indoors than outdoors, and mechanically ventilated rooms contained less diverse microbial communities than did window-ventilated rooms. Bacterial communities in indoor environments contained many taxa that are absent or rare outdoors, including taxa closely related to potential human pathogens. Building attributes, specifically the source of ventilation air, airflow rates, relative humidity and temperature, were correlated with the diversity and composition of indoor bacterial communities. The relative abundance of bacteria closely related to human pathogens was higher indoors than outdoors, and higher in rooms with lower airflow rates and lower relative humidity. The observed relationship between building design and airborne bacterial diversity suggests that we can manage indoor environments, altering through building design and operation the community of microbial species that potentially colonize the human microbiome during our time indoors.},

abstract = {The role of theory within ecology has changed dramatically in recent decades. Once primarily a 10 source of qualitative conceptual framing, ecological theories and models are now often used to 11 develop quantitative explanations of empirical patterns and to project future dynamics of specific 12 ecological systems. In this essay, I recount my own experience of this transformation, in which 13 accelerating computing power and the widespread incorporation of stochastic processes into 14 ecological theory combined to create some novel integration of mathematical and statistical 15 models. This stronger integration drives theory towards incorporating more biological realism, 16 and I explore ways in which we can grapple with that realism to generate new general theoretical 17 insights. This enhanced realism, in turn, may lead to frameworks for projecting ecological 18 responses to anthropogenic change, which is, arguably, the central challenge for 21 st century 19 ecology. In an era of big data and synthesis, ecologists are increasingly seeking to infer causality 20 from observational data; but conventional biometry provides few tools for this project. This is a 21 realm where theorists can and should play an important role, and I close by pointing towards 22 some analytical and philosophical approaches developed in our sister discipline of economics 23 that address this very problem. While I make no grand prognostications about the likely 24 discoveries of ecological theory over the coming century, you will find in this essay a scattering 25 of more or less far-fetched ideas that I, at least, think are interesting and (possibly) fruitful 26 directions for our field. 27 28},

abstract = {Many species exhibit widespread spatial synchrony in population fluctuations. This pattern is of great ecological interest and can be a source of concern when the species is rare or endangered. Both dispersal and spatial correlations in the environment have been implicated as possible causes of this pattern, but these two factors have rarely been studied in combination. We develop a spatially structured population model, simple enough to obtain analytic solutions for the population correlation, that incorporates both dispersal and environmental correlation. We ask whether these two synchronizing factors contribute additively to the total spatial population covariance. We find that there is always an interaction between these two factors and that this interaction is small only when one or both of the environmental correlation and the dispersal rate are small. The interaction is opposite in sign to the environmental correlation; so, in the normal case of positive environmental correlation across sites, the population synchrony will be lower than predicted by simply adding the effects of dispersal and environmental correlation. We also find that population synchrony declines as the strength of population regulation increases. These results indicate that dispersal and environmental correlation need to be considered in combination as explanations for observed patterns of population synchrony.},

abstract = {Spatial extent can have two important consequences for population dynamics: It can generate spatial structure, in which individuals interact more intensely with neighbors than with more distant conspecifics, and it allows for environmental heterogeneity, in which habitat quality varies spatially. Studies of these features are difficult to interpret because the models are complex and sometimes idiosyncratic. Here we analyze one of the simplest possible spatial population models, to understand the mathematical basis for the observed patterns: two patches coupled by dispersal, with dynamics in each patch governed by the logistic map. With suitable choices of parameters, this model can represent spatial structure, environmental heterogeneity, or both in combination. We synthesize previous work and new analyses on this model, with two goals: to provide a comprehensive baseline to aid our understanding of more complex spatial models, and to generate predictions about the effects of spatial structure and environmental heterogeneity on population dynamics. Spatial structure alone can generate positive, negative, or zero spatial correlations between patches when dispersal rates are high, medium, or low relative to the complexity of the local dynamics. It can also lead to quasiperiodicity and hyperchaos, which are not present in the nonspatial model. With density-independent dispersal, spatial structure cannot destabilize equilibria or periodic orbits that would be stable in the absence of space. When densities in the two patches are uncorrelated, the probability that the population in a patch reaches extreme low densities is reduced relative to the same patch in isolation; this "rescue effect" would reduce the probability of metapopulation extinction beyond the simple effect of spreading of risk. Pure environmental heterogeneity always produces positive spatial correlations. The dynamics of the entire population is approximated by a nonspatial model with mean patch characteristics. This approximation worsens as the difference between the patches increases and the dispersal rate decreases: Under extreme conditions, destabilization of equilibria and periodic orbits occurs at mean parameter values lower than those predicted by the mean parameters. Apparent within-patch dynamics are distorted: The local population appears to have the wrong growth parameter and a constant number of immigrants (or emigrants) per generation. Adding environmental heterogeneity to spatial structure increases the occurrence of spatially correlated population dynamics, but the resulting temporal dynamics are more complex than would be predicted by the mean parameter values. The three classes of spatial pattern (positive, negative, and zero correlation), while still mathematically distinct, become increasingly similar phenomenologically.},

abstract = {Biological invasions are a pervasive and costly environmental problem that has been the focus of intense management and research activities over the past half century. Yet accurate predictions of community susceptibility to invasion remain elusive. The diversity resistance hypothesis, which argues that diverse communities are highly competitive and readily resist invasion, is supported by both theory and experimental studies conducted at small spatial scales. However, there is also convincing evidence that the relationship between the diversity of native and invading species is positive when measured at regional scales. Although this latter relationship may arise from extrinsic factors, such as resource heterogeneity, that covary with diversity of native and invading species at large scales, the mechanisms conferring greater invasion resistance to diverse communities at local scales remain unknown. Using neighbourhood analyses, a technique from plant competition studies, we show here that species diversity in small experimental grassland plots enhances invasion resistance by increasing crowding and species richness in localized plant neighbourhoods. Both the establishment (number of invaders) and success (proportion of invaders that are large) of invading plants are reduced. These results suggest that local biodiversity represents an important line of defence against the spread of invaders.},

abstract = {Fragmented populations possess an intriguing duplicity: even if subpopulations are reliably extinction-prone, asynchrony in local extinctions and recolonizations makes global persistence possible. Migration is a double-edged sword in such cases: too little migration prevents recolonization of extinct patches, whereas too much synchronizes subpopulations, raising the likelihood of global extinction. Both edges of this proverbial sword have been explored by manipulating the rate of migration within experimental populations. However, few experiments have examined how the evolutionary ecology of fragmented populations depends on the pattern of migration. Here, we show that the migration pattern affects both coexistence and evolution within a community of bacterial hosts (Escherichia coli) and viral pathogens (T4 coliphage) distributed across a large network of subpopulations. In particular, different patterns of migration select for distinct pathogen strategies, which we term 'rapacious' and 'prudent'. These strategies define a 'tragedy of the commons': rapacious phage displace prudent variants for shared host resources, but prudent phage are more productive when alone. We find that prudent phage dominate when migration is spatially restricted, while rapacious phage evolve under unrestricted migration. Thus, migration pattern alone can determine whether a de novo tragedy of the commons is resolved in favour of restraint.},

abstract = {Background: The microbiome of the home is of great interest because of its possible impact on health. Our goal was to identify some of the factors that determine the richness, evenness and diversity of the home's fungal and bacterial microbiomes. Method: Vacuumed settled dust from homes (n=35) in Cincinnati, OH, were analyzed by pyrosequencing to determine the fungal and bacterial relative sequence occurrence. The correlation coefficients between home environmental characteristics, including age of home, Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) values, occupant number, relative humidity and temperature, as well as pets (dog and cat) were evaluated for their influence on fungal and bacterial communities. In addition, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used for identifying fungal and bacterial genera and species associated with those housing determinants found to be significant. Results: The fungal richness was found to be positively correlated with age of home (p=0.002), ERMI value (p=0.003), and relative humidity (p=0.015) in the home. However, fungal evenness and diversity were only correlated with the age of home (p=0.001). Diversity and evenness (not richness) of the bacterial microbiome in the homes were associated with dog ownership.Linear discriminant analysis showed total of 39 putative fungal genera/species with significantly higher LDA scores in high ERMI homes and 47 genera/species with significantly higher LDA scores in homes with high relative humidity. When categorized according to the age of the home, a total of 67 fungal genera/species had LDA scores above the significance threshold. Dog ownership appeared to have the most influence on the bacterial microbiome, since a total of 130 bacterial genera/species had significantly higher LDA scores in homes with dogs. Conclusions: Some key determinants of the fungal and bacterial microbiome appear to be excess moisture, age of the home and dog ownership.},

abstract = {Models of metapopulations have focused on the effects of extinction and colonization rate upon metapopulation persistence and dynamics, assuming static landscapes wherein patches are neither created nor go extinct. However, for species living in ephemeral (patchy) habitats, landscapes are highly dynamic rather than static. In this article, we develop a lattice metapopulation model, of the patch occupancy type, based on interacting particle systems that incorporate explicitly both metapopulation and patch dynamics. Un- der this scenario, we study the effects of different regimes of patch dynamics upon metapopulation persistence. We analyze the lattice behavior by numerical simulations and a mean field approximation (MF). We show that metapopulation persistence and extinction are strongly influenced by the rate at which the landscape changes, in addition to the amount of habitat destroyed.We derive MFanalytical expressions for extinction thresholds related to landscape properties such as habitat suitability and patch average lifetime. Using numerical simulations, we also show how these thresholds are quantitatively overestimated by the MF equations, although the qualitative behavior of the spatial model is well explained by the MF when the array of habitat patches is dynamic or static but connected in space and time. The implications for conservation are also discussed.},

abstract = {The relationship between physiological traits and fitness often depends on environmental conditions. In variable environments, different species may be favored through time, which can influence both the nature of trait evolution and the ecological dynamics underlying community composition. To determine how fluctuating environmental conditions favor species with different physiological traits over time, we combined long-term data on survival and fecundity of species in a desert annual plant community with data on weather and physiological traits. For each year, we regressed the standardized annual fitness of each species on its position along a tradeoff between relative growth rate and water-use efficiency. Next, we determined how variations in the slopes and intercepts of these fitness-physiology functions related to year-to-year variations in temperature and precipitation. Years with a relatively high percentage of small rain events and a greater number of days between precipitation pulse events tended to be worse, on average, for all desert annual species. Species with high relative growth rates and low water-use efficiency had greater standardized annual fitness than other species in years with greater numbers of large rain events. Conversely, species with high water-use efficiency had greater standardized annual fitness in years with small rain events and warm temperatures late in the growing season. These results reveal how weather variables interact with physiological traits of co-occurring species to determine interannual variations in survival and fecundity, which has important implications for understanding population and community dynamics.},

abstract = {Predator switching is often assumed to be a stabilizing force in predator-prey interactions. Recent models, however, have shown that predator switching can have a destabilizing effect on populations, creating cycles or even extinctions of predators and prey. However, most of these models have been traditional top-down mathematical models that do not incorporate individual variability or evolution. We explored the influence of predator switching on predator-prey stability, persistence and evolution using an individual-based, spatially explicit model of predators switching between two prey patches. We also created difference equation models for comparison with the simulations. We found that individual variability among predators, and selection acting on switching thresholds, helped in maintaining stability and persistence in our predator-prey system. Predators that estimated prey density (with error) or had 'short memories' produced more stable population dynamics than predators with perfect knowledge of prey density or had 'long memories'. The threshold prey density at which switching occurred evolved in the predator population to be greater than the predicted optimal density. This result led to undermatching of predators to their resources and tended to increase predator-prey stability. Furthermore, multiple switching thresholds could be maintained in the predator population at the same time. These results suggest that in an ecological system with individual predators switching between prey species, predator switching may help stabilize predator-prey interactions.},

abstract = {Some simple formulae were obtained which enable us to estimate evolutionary distances in terms of the number of nucleotide substitutions (and, also, the evolutionary rates when the divergence times are known). In comparing a pair of nucleotide sequences, we distinguish two types of differences; if homologous sites are occupied by different nucleotide bases but both are purines or both pyrimidines, the difference is called type I (or "transition" type), while, if one of the two is a purine and the other is a pyrimidine, the difference is called type II (or "transversion" type). Letting P and Q be respectively the fractions of nucleotide sites showing type I and type II differences between two sequences compared, then the evolutionary distance per site is K = -(1/2) ln [(1-2P-Q) square root of 1-2Q]. The evolutionary rate per year is then given by k = K/(2T), where T is the time since the divergence of the two sequences. If only the third codon positions are compared, the synonymous component of the evolutionary base substitutions per site is estimated by K'S = -(1/2) ln (1-2P-Q). Also, formulae for standard errors were obtained. Some examples were worked out using reported globin sequences to show that synonymous substitutions occur at much higher rates than amino acid-altering substitutions in evolution.},

abstract = {Humans increasingly occupy cities. Globally, about 50{\%} of the total human population lives in urban environments and in spite of some trends for deurbanization, the transition from rural to urban life is expected to accelerate in the future, especially in developing nations and regions. The Republic of Korea, for example, has witnesses a dramatic rise in its urban population, which now accounts for nearly 90{\%} of all resident; the increase from about 29{\%} in 1955 has been attributed to multiple factors, but has clearly been driven by extraordinary growth in the gross domestic product accompanying industrialization. While industrialization and urbanization have unarguably led to major improvements in quality of life indices in Korea and elsewhere, numerous serious problems ahve also been acknowleged, including concerns about resource availability, water quality, amplification of global warming and new threats to health. Questions about sustainability have therefore led Koreans and others to consider deurbanization as a management policy. Whether this offers any realistic prospects for a sustainable future remains to be seen. In the interim, it has become increasingly clear that built environments are no less complex that natural environments, and that they depend on a variety of internal and external connections involving microbes and the processes for which microbes are resposible. I provide here a definition of the urban microbiome, and through examples indicate its centrality to human function and wellbeing in urban systems. I also identify important knowledge gaps and unanswered questions about urban microbiomes that must be addressed to develop a robust, predictive, and general understanding of urban biology and ecology that can be used to inform policy-making for sustainable systems.},

abstract = {Natural systems harbor complex interactions that are fundamental parts of ecology and evolution. These interactions challenge our inclinations and training to seek the simplest explanations of patterns in nature. Not least is the likelihood that some complex processes might be missed when their patterns look similar to predictions for simpler mechanisms. Along these lines, theory and empirical evidence increasingly suggest that environmental, ecological, phenotypic, and genetic processes can be tightly intertwined, resulting in complex and sometimes surprising eco-evolutionary dynamics. The goal of this review is to temper inclinations to unquestioningly seek the simplest explanations in ecology and evolution, by recognizing that some eco-evolutionary outcomes may appear very similar to purely ecological, purely evolutionary, or even null expectations, and thus be cryptic. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for observational biases and mechanisms that might operate among the various links in eco-evolutionary feedbacks to produce cryptic patterns. Recognition that cryptic dynamics can be associated with outcomes like stability, resilience, recovery, or coexistence in a dynamically changing world provides added impetus for finding ways to study them.},

abstract = {Hierarchical competition-colonization models have been used to explain limiting similarities among species, successional dynamics, and species loss under habitat destruction. This class of models assumes that there is an inverse relationship between competitive ability and colonization ability and that competitively superior species exclude competitively inferior species when both occupy the same site. This hierarchical model of performance trade-offs, however, exhibits some unusual behaviors in the high-diversity limit, including infinitesimally close species packing, pathologically slow dynamics, and fundamentally important regularities in trait-abundance relationships. In particular, under the condition of constant mortality across species, a 3/2-power-law relationship emerges between abundance and fecundity under infinite packing (abundance of a species with fecundity f is inversely proportional to f to the 3/2 power). In this article, we explore the high-diversity limit of the hierarchical competition-colonization model, with particular emphasis on patterns of species packing, species-abundance relationships, and system stability. Because of the potential for pathologically slow dynamics following perturbations and infinitesimally close species packing in the high-diversity limit for this class of models, the models may need to be modified to include more realistic mechanisms governing the extent and timing of interspecific competitive exclusion in order to effectively capture the structure and dynamics of real-world ecosystems.

abstract = {Leucine incorporation was examined as a method for estimating rates of protein synthesis by bacterial assemblages in natural aquatic systems. The proportion of the total bacterial population that took up leucine in three marine environments was high (greater than 50{\%}). Most of the leucine (greater than 90{\%}) taken up was incorporated into protein, and little (less than 20{\%}) was degraded to other amino acids, except in two oligotrophic marine environments. In samples from these two environments, ca. 50{\%} of the leucine incorporated had been degraded to other amino acids, which were subsequently incorporated into protein. The degree of leucine degradation appears to depend on the organic carbon supply, as the proportion of 3H-radioactivity incorporated into protein that was recovered as [3H]leucine after acid hydrolysis increased with the addition of pyruvate to oligotrophic water samples. The addition of extracellular leucine inhibited total incorporation of [14C]pyruvate (a precursor for leucine biosynthesis) into protein. Furthermore, the proportion of [14C]pyruvate incorporation into protein that was recovered as [14C]leucine decreased with the addition of extracellular leucine. These results show that the addition of extracellular leucine inhibits leucine biosynthesis by marine bacterial assemblages. The molar fraction of leucine in a wide variety of proteins is constant, indicating that changes in leucine incorporation rates reflect changes in rates of protein synthesis rather than changes in the leucine content of proteins. The results demonstrate that the incorporation rate of [3H]leucine into a hot trichloroacetic acid-insoluble cell fraction can serve as an index of protein synthesis by bacterial assemblages in aquatic systems.},

Rates of leucine and methionine biosynthesis were estimated from the incorporation of super(14)C-pyruvate and super(35)SO sub(4)@)u- super(2), respectively. Leucine inhibited super(14)C-pyruvate and super(3)H-glucose incorporation and methionine inhibited super(35)SO sub(4) incorporation.

abstract = {A factor that may limit the ability of many populations to adapt to changing conditions is the rate at which beneficial mutations can become established. We study the probability that mutations become established in changing environments by extending the classic theory for branching processes. When environments change in time, under quite general conditions, the establishment probability is approximately twice the 'effective selection coefficient', whose value is an average that gives most weight to a mutant's fitness in the generations immediately after it appears. When fitness varies along a gradient in a continuous habitat, increased dispersal generally decreases the chance a mutation establishes because mutations move out of areas where they are most adapted. When there is a patch of favourable habitat that moves in time, there is a maximum speed of movement above which mutations cannot become established, regardless of when and where they first appear. This critical speed limit, which is proportional to the mutation's maximum selective advantage, represents an absolute constraint on the potential of locally adapted mutations to contribute to evolutionary rescue.},

abstract = {Redfield noted the similarity between the average nitrogen-to- phosphorus ratio in plankton (N:P 5 16 by atoms) and in deep oceanic waters (N:P 5 15; refs 1, 2). He argued that this was neither a coincidence, nor the result of the plankton adapting to the oceanic stoichiometry, but rather that phytoplankton adjust the N:P stoichiometry of the ocean to meet their requirements through nitrogen fixation, an idea supported by recent modelling studies3,4 . But what determines the N:P requirements of phyto- plankton? Here we use a stoichiometrically explicit model of phytoplankton physiology and resource competition to derive from first principles the optimal phytoplankton stoichiometry under diverse ecological scenarios. Competitive equilibrium favours greater allocation to P-poor resource-acquisition machinery and therefore a higher N:P ratio; exponential growth favours greater allocation to P-rich assembly machinery and therefore a lower N:P ratio. P-limited environments favour slightly less allocation to assembly than N-limited or light- limited environments. The model predicts that optimal N:P ratios will vary from 8.2 to 45.0, depending on the ecological conditions. Our results show that the canonical Redfield N:P ratio of 16 is not a universal biochemical optimum, but instead represents an average of species-specific N:P ratios.},

The unknown strength of competition-mediated indirect effects makes it difficult to predict species abundances in the face of ongoing environmental change. Theory developed with phenomenological competition models shows that indirect effects are weak when coexistence is strongly stabilized, but these models lack a mechanistic link between environmental change and species performance. To extend existing theory, we examined the relationship between coexistence and indirect effects in mechanistic resource competition models. We defined environmental change as a change in resource supply points and quantified the resulting competition-mediated indirect effects on species abundances. We found that the magnitude of indirect effects increases in proportion to niche overlap. However, indirect effects also depend on differences in how competitors respond to the chan...},

abstract = {1. We studied the spatial and temporal patterns of change in a suite of twenty-one chemical and biological variables in a lake district in arctic Alaska, U.S.A. The study included fourteen stream sites and ten lake sites, nine of which were in a direct series of surface drainage. All twenty-four sites were sampled between one and five times a year from 1991 to 1997. 2. Stream sites tended to have higher values of major anions and cations than the lake sites, while the lake sites had higher values of particulate carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and chlorophyll a. There were consistent and statistically significant differences in concentrations of variables measured at the inlet versus the outlet of lakes, and in variables measured at upstream versus downstream sites in the stream reaches which connect the lakes. In-lake processing tended to consume alkalinity, conductivity, H+, DIC, Ca2+, Mg2+, CO2, CH4, and NO3–, and produce K+ and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In-stream processing resulted in the opposite trends (e.g. consumption of K+ and DOC), and the magnitudes of change were often similar to those measured in the lakes but with the opposite sign. 3. Observed spatial patterns in the study lakes included mean concentrations of variables which increased, decreased or were constant along the lake chain from high to low altitude in the catchment (stream sites showed no spatial patterns with any variables). The strongest spatial patterns were of increasing conductivity, Ca2+, Mg2+, alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon and pH with lake chain number (high to low altitude in the basin). These patterns were partly determined by the effect of increasing catchment area feeding into lakes further downslope, and partly by the systematic processing of materials in lakes and in the stream segments between lakes. 4. Synchrony (the temporal coherence or correlation of response) of variables across all lakes ranged from 0.18 for particulate phosphorus to 0.90 for Mg2+ the average synchrony for all twenty-one variables was 0.50. The synchronous behaviour of lake pairs was primarily related to the spatial location or proximity of the lakes for all variables taken together and for many individual variables, and secondarily, to the catchment to lake area ratio and the water residence time. 5. These results illustrate that, over small geographic areas, and somewhat independent of lake or stream morphometry, the consistent and directional (downslope) processing of materials helps produce spatial patterns which are coherent over time for many limnological variables. We combine concepts from stream, lake and landscape ecology, and develop a conceptual view of landscape mass balance. This view highlights that the integration of material processing in both lakes and rivers is critical for understanding the structure and function of surface waters, especially from a landscape perspective.},

abstract = {We present a model to study the effects of delayed germination and dispersal on population behavior of annual organisms. The emphasis is on the density-independent situation. We study the dependence of optimal combinations of dispersal and germination on the environmental conditions if dispersal and germination rates are optimized simultaneously. Delayed germination is favored if population growth is low and fluctuations of the reproductive success in the subpopulations are positively correlated. Dispersal is favored if population growth is high and subpopulations fluctuate uncorrelated. If optimization is not done simulatenously but if dispersal or germination is kept fixed at a certain level, the optimal dispersal rate decreases with decreasing germination and the optimal germination rate increases with increasing dispersal. The results of the density-independent model are compared with the results of computer simulation for the density-dependent situation. A literature survey brought to light only few reported combinations of data suitable for testing the model. The best ones were found in ??dum (1978, "Dormant Seeds in Danish Ruderal Soils, an Experimental Study of Relations between Seed Bank and Pioneer Flora," Royal Vet. and Agric. Univ. Horsholm Arboretum, Denmark) and Grime et al. (1981, J. Ecol. 69, 1017-1061). From a combination of their data with information on dispersal capabilities it appears that there exists a negative correlation between dispersal and delayed germination in annuals, as predicted. ?? 1987.},

abstract = {Bacillus spores are highly resistant to many environmental stresses, owing in part to the presence of multiple "extracellular" layers. Although the role of some of these extracellular layers in resistance to particular stresses is known, the function of one of the outermost layers, the spore coat, is not completely understood. This study sought to determine whether the spore coat plays a role in resistance to predation by the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena, which uses phagocytosis to ingest and degrade other microorganisms. Wild-type dormant spores of Bacillus subtilis were efficiently ingested by the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila but were neither digested nor killed. However, spores with various coat defects were killed and digested, leaving only an outer shell termed a rind, and supporting the growth of Tetrahymena. A similar rind was generated when coat-defective spores were treated with lysozyme alone. The sensitivity of spores with different coat defects to predation by T. thermophila paralleled the spores' sensitivities to lysozyme. Spore killing by T. thermophila was by means of lytic enzymes within the protozoal phagosome, not by initial spore germination followed by killing. These findings suggest that a major function of the coat of spores of Bacillus species is to protect spores against predation. We also found that indigestible rinds were generated even from spores in which cross-linking of coat proteins was greatly reduced, implying the existence of a coat structure that is highly resistant to degradative enzymes.},

abstract = {The distinct rhizomorphic mats formed by ectomycorrhizal Piloderma fungi are common features of the organic soil horizons of coniferous forests of the Pacific Northwest. These mats have been found to cover 25-40{\%} of the forest floor in some Douglas-fir stands, and are associated with physical and biochemical properties that distinguish them from the surrounding non-mat soils. In this study, we examined the fungal and bacterial communities associated with Piloderma mat and non-mat soils. Each mat and non-mat area was repeatedly sampled at four times throughout the year. Characterization of the mat activity and community was achieved using a combination of N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGase) enzyme assays, and molecular analysis of fungal and bacterial communities using T-RFLP profiles, clone libraries, and quantitative PCR. Piloderma mats had consistently greater NAGase activity across all dates, although the magnitude of the difference varied by season. Furthermore, we found distinct fungal and bacterial communities associated with the Piloderma mats, yet the size of the microbial populations differed little between the mat and non-mat soils. Significant temporal variation was seen in the NAGase activity and in the sizes of the fungal and bacterial populations, but the community composition remained stable through time. Our results demonstrate the presence of two distinct microbial communities occupying the forest floor of Douglas-fir stands, whose populations and activities fluctuate seasonally but with little change in composition, which appears to be related to the physiochemical nature of mat and non-mat habitats. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Species diversity at the local-community scale can be altered by numerous factors, including disturbances, predators, and resource levels. Intermediate levels of these three factors are predicted to enhance coexistence and diversity. However, no study has examined how these factors may interact to alter community composition. The protozoan and rotifer community that colonized containers set in a forest was used to examine the interactions between these local community processes. We conducted a fully factorial microcosm experiment that manipulated disturbance frequency, predator density, and resource levels to examine protozoan and rotifer richness, community composition, and species abundance. Species richness was significantly altered by disturbances and predators, while predator densities interacted with disturbances and resources. Total abundance was significantly affected by each treatment, as well as a disturbance and predator interaction. We found that community composition was altered by each of the treatments and their interactions, indicating that different groups of species were present depending on the treatments. These results indicate that strong species sorting occurs in this community. Understanding these factors alone and in concert can provide insight to the potential complexities that underlie community structure and species composition.},

abstract = {We examined effects of leaf litter quality and species mixing on microbial community diversity and litter processing in a forested headwater stream. Single- and mixed-species litter from dominant tree species (Liriodendron tulipifera, Acer rubrum, Quercus prinus, Rhododendron maximum) were incubated in a southern Appalachian headwater stream. Litter carbon-to-nitrogen ratios (C:N), mass loss, microbial respiration, and microbial community diversity were analyzed on individual litter species after incubation. Initial C:N varied widely among individual litter species, and these differences persisted throughout the 50-day incubation period. Litter C:N of the recalcitrant species R. maximum remained higher than that of all other litter species, and C:N of R. maximum and L. tulipifera increased when both species were present together in a mixture. Although mass loss of individual species was generally unaffected by mixing, microbial respiration was greater on A. rubrum and Q. prinus litter incubated with R. maximum compared to either species alone. Enhanced resource heterogeneity, which was experimentally achieved by litter mixing low- and higher-quality litter species, resulted in apparent shifts in microbial community diversity on individual litter species. Responses of bacterial and fungal community diversity to litter mixing varied among individual litter species. Our results suggest that changes in tree species composition in riparian forests and subsequent changes in litter resource heterogeneity could alter stream microbial community diversity and function. As bacteria and fungi are important decomposers of plant litter in aquatic ecosystems, resource-dependent changes in microbial communities could alter detrital processing dynamics in streams.},

Ninety six-well microtiter plates containing various carbon substrates permit these patterns to be determined quickly, economically, and effectively. The use of these patterns to characterize and differentiate strains isolated from the environment has been very effective in providing information on the culturable fraction of the microbial community. Another approach involves the direct inoculation of natural samples into these microtiter plates; this approach has several fundamental problems. The inoculation of low cell densities into the wells means that the technique is a culture-based method in which the biases of enrichment culture may render the results unrepresentative of the native microbiota. The physiological state of the inoculated microbes may affect the kinetics and pattern of substrate utilization. As a measure of the functional diversity of microbial communities, this approach suffers because the tested substrates do not accurately represent the types of substrates present in ecosystems, and the metabolic redundancy of species implies that changes in the response may only crudely represent the actual microbial population dynamics. Therefore, although this approach can be used to determine whether environmental samples differ in their response patterns, it is unclear how it can be used to provide fundamental information on questions of microbial diversity.},

In this review, we examine when and how the process and patterns of bacterial adaptation might funda- mentally differ from those of macrobes, highlight methods used to measure adaptation in natural microbial populations, and discuss the importance of examining bacterial adaptation across multiple scales. We emphasize the need to consider the scales of adaptation as continua, in which the genetic makeup of bacteria blur boundaries between populations, species, and com- munitiesandwiththemconcepts of ecologicalandevolutionary time. Finally, we examine current directions of the field as we move beyond the stamp- collecting phase and toward a better understanding of microbial adaptation in nature.},

abstract = {Taxa co-occurring in communities often represent a nonrandom sample, in phenotypic or phylogenetic terms, of the regional species pool. While heuristic arguments have identified processes that create community phylogenetic patterns, further progress hinges on a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between underlying ecological and evolutionary processes. We created a simulation framework to model trait evolution, assemble communities (via competition, habitat filtering, or neutral assembly), and test the phylogenetic pattern of the resulting communities. We found that phylogenetic community structure is greatest when traits are highly conserved and when multiple traits influence species membership in communities. Habitat filtering produces stronger phylogenetic structure when taxa with derived (as opposed to ancestral) traits are favored in the community. Nearest-relative tests have greater power to detect patterns due to competition, while total community relatedness tests perform better with habitat filtering. The size of the local community relative to the regional pool strongly influences statistical power; in general, power increases with larger pool sizes for communities created by filtering but decreases for communities created by competition. Our results deepen our understanding of processes that contribute to phylogenetic community structure and provide guidance for the design and interpretation of empirical research.},

abstract = {One of the most pervasive concepts in the study of community assembly is the metaphor of the environmental filter, which refers to abiotic factors that prevent the establishment or persistence of species in a particular location. The metaphor has its origins in the study of community change during succession and in plant community dynamics, although it has gained considerable attention recently as part of a surge of interest in functional trait and phylogenetic-based approaches to the study of communities. While the filtering metaphor has clear utility in some circumstances, it has been challenging to reconcile the environmental filtering concept with recent developments in ecological theory related to species coexistence. These advances suggest that the evidence used in many studies to assess environmental filtering is insufficient to distinguish filtering from the outcome of biotic interactions. We re-examine the environmental filtering metaphor from the perspective of coexistence theory. In an effort to move the discussion forward, we present a simple framework for considering the role of the environment in shaping community membership, review the literature to document the evidence typically used in environmental filtering studies and highlight research challenges to address in coming years. The current usage of the environmental filtering term in empirical studies likely overstates the role abiotic tolerances play in shaping community structure. We recommend that the term ‘environmental filtering' only be used to refer to cases where the abiotic environment prevents establishment or persistence in the absence of biotic interactions, although only 15{\%} of the studies in our review presented such evidence. Finally, we urge community ecologists to consider additional mechanisms aside from environmental filtering by which the abiotic environment can shape community pattern.},

abstract = {The typical freshwater algal community can be roughly categorised into two groups according to the distribution of biomass with cell size. Algae in the small size group are known to be edible for zooplankton grazers; large algae are much less edible. To model population dynamics of a size selective zooplankton predator like Daphnia we thus consider a 3-species predator-prey model with an "edible" and an "inedible" prey. We show that a system which in the absence of inedible algae exhibits cyclic dynamics may exhibit a stable equilibrium if inedible algae are introduced. This stabilisation can be caused by one or both of the following mechanisms: (a) "indirect interaction" involving interspecific competition between the prey which reduces the effective carrying capacity of the edible species, and (b) "direct interaction" in which there is a reduction of the attack rate on the edible prey when the predator spends time handling inedibles. We study the behaviour of the system under enrichment. With only the indirect interaction, the equilibrium density of the edible prey is unaffected by enrichment, but the density of both inedible prey and predator increases. With sufficient enrichment the system can always be destabilised. If there is direct interaction, the equilibrium density of all three species increases with enrichment; the edible fraction decreases, but has a lower bound. If the direct interaction is sufficiently strong there are regions of parameter space for which the system can never be destabilised by enrichment.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to explore the variation and regulation of bacterial carbon processing at a coastal oligotrophic site of the Island of Majorca in the Mediterranean Sea. In situ bacterial production (BP), respiration (BR), growth efficiency, and carbon demand in relation to environmental parameters were studied over an annual cycle. In addition, the response of bacterial carbon processing to an experimental resource (phosphate) and temperature manipulations was tested. While concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and phosphorus were fairly stable over the year, BP and BR varied 65-fold and 79-fold, respectively. Addition of phosphate stimulated both BP and BR during most of the year, suggesting that phosphorus limitation keeps a tight rein on bacterial DOC utilization. Both BP and BR responded positively to a 2 degrees C experimental increase, but at higher temperature increases BP and BR leveled off or decreased. In situ BP and BR were positively related to temperature, suggesting that elevated water temperature would yield increased BP and BR. BR responded more strongly to temperature than BP, suggesting that increased temperature may result in a decrease in bacterial growth efficiency.},

abstract = {We investigate the effect of seed predation on the coexistence of competing annual plants. We demonstrate a role for predation that is opposite to the conventional wisdom that predation promotes coexistence by reducing the intensity of competition. In the common situation where competitive coexistence involves intraspecific competition exceeding interspecific competition, predation can undermine coexistence by reducing the overall magnitude of competition, replacing competition with "apparent competition" in a way that does not lead to differential intraspecific and interspecific effects. We demonstrate this outcome in the case where coexistence occurs by "the storage effect" in a variable environment. The storage effect arises when the environment interacts with competition to create opportunities for species to increase from low density. Critical to the storage effect is positive covariance between the response of population growth to the environment and its response to competition, when a species is at high density. This outcome prevents species at high density from taking advantage of favorable environmental conditions. A species at low density has lower covariance and can take advantage of favorable environmental conditions, giving it an advantage over a high-density species, fostering its recovery from low density. Hence, species coexistence is promoted. Here we find that density-dependent predation lowers population densities, and so weakens competition, replacing competition with apparent competition, which does not covary with the environment. As a consequence, covariance between environment and competition is weakened, reducing the advantage to a species at low density. The species still strongly interact through the combination of competition and apparent competition, but the reduced low-density advantage reduces their ability to coexist. Although this result is demonstrated specifically for the storage effect with a focus on annual plant communities, the principles involved are general ones.},

abstract = {River systems form dendritic ecological networks that influence the spatial structure of riverine communities. Few empirical studies have evaluated how regional, dispersal-related processes and local habitat factors interact to govern network patterns of species composition. We explore such interactions in a boreal watershed and show that riparian-plant species richness increases strongly with drainage size, i.e., with downstream position in the network. Assemblage composition was nested, with new species successively added downstream. These spatial patterns in species composition were related to a combination of local and regional processes. Breadth in local habitat conditions increased downstream in the network, resulting in higher habitat heterogeneity and reduced niche overlap among species, which, together with similar trends in disturbance, allows more species to coexist. Riparian edaphic conditions were also increasingly favorable to more species within the regional pool along larger streams, with greater nitrogen availability (manifested as lower C/N) and more rapid mineralization of C and N (as indicated by ratios of stable isotopes) observed with downstream position in the network. The number of species with capacity for water dispersal increased with stream size providing a mechanistic link between plant traits and the downstream accumulation of species as more propagules arrive from upstream sites. Similarity in species composition between sites was related to both geographical and environmental distance. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that position in the river network drives spatial patterns in riparian-plant diversity and composition by the joint influence of local (disturbance, habitat conditions and breadth) and regional (dispersal) forces.},

abstract = {Ecological niche construction, the process whereby an organism improves its environment to enhance its growth and persistence, is an important missing element of niche theory. Niche theory has mainly focused on niche-deteriorating processes, such as resource consumption, predation and competition, which have negative effects on population growth. Here, we integrate niche construction explicitly into modern niche theory. We use a graphical approach to analyse how a species' niche-improving impacts interplay with niche-deteriorating impacts to modify its response to the environment. In a model of two consumers that compete for one limiting resource and one predator, we show how niche construction modifies the traditional niche-deteriorating impacts of its agent or of competing species, and hence the potential for species coexistence. By altering the balance between intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects, niche construction can either generate net interspecific facilitation or strengthen interspecific competition. The adaptive benefit derived from niche construction also strongly affects the realized niche of a niche-constructing species.},

abstract = {The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and spore-forming bacteria of the Bacillus genus are both common soil inhabitants. In this study, we investigated the interaction of the bacteriophagous C. elegans with these bacteria. We observed that vegetative forms of Bacillus species are highly sensitive to ingestion by C. elegans. In contrast, we found that spores are highly resistant to the worm's digestive process. Spore protective structures such as the spore coat likely hinder access of digestive enzymes such as lysozyme to sensitive structures like the cell wall and thus facilitate passage of the spore through the digestive tract. We developed methods to monitor the uptake of vegetative cells and spores and found that the spores have a particularly slow transit through the worm's intestine suggesting that the nematode may consider spores as inert particles rather than as food. Thus, the results of this study show that spores have features that enable them to stay longer times in the nematode intestine, suggesting that this transit of Bacillus sp. may have important implications for the evolution of resistance properties.},

abstract = {Organisms regularly modify local resource distributions, influencing both their ecosystems and the evolution of traits whose fitness depends on such alterable sources of natural selection in environments. We call these processes niche construction. We explore the evolutionary consequences of niche construction using a two-locus population genetic model, which extends earlier analyses by allowing resource distributions to be influenced both by niche construction and by independent processes of renewal and depletion. The analysis confirms that niche construction can be a potent evolutionary agent by generating selection that leads to the fixation of otherwise deleterious alleles, supporting stable polymorphisms where none are expected, eliminating what would otherwise be stable polymorphisms, and generating unusual evolutionary dynamics. Even small amounts of niche construction, or niche construction that only weakly affects resource dynamics, can significantly alter both ecological and evolutionary patterns.},

abstract = {A basic demographic model is constructed for territorial species in a region where patches of habitat suitable for survival and reproduction are randomly (or evenly) interspersed with patches of unsuitable habitat. The model predicts the equilibrium occupancy of suitable habitat as a function of the proportion of the region composed of suitable habitat, h, and of the demographic potential of the population, k, which is determined by parameters of the life history and dispersal behavior of individuals. If 0 {\textless} k {\textless} 1, the demographic potential gives the equilibrium occupancy in a completely suitable region, and the population will become extinct in the region if h {\$}\backslashleq{\$} 1 - k. Difficulty in finding a mate, the finite extent of the region containing suitable habitat, and serially uncorrelated fluctuations in life history parameters all increase the minimum value of h necessary to sustain a population. Models of this type should be useful for predicting the effects of habitat destruction and fragmentation, or habitat improvement, on the population sizes of rare or endangered species with territorial behavior.},

abstract = {The present paper is an attempt to provide a set of models which will be more useful in the analysis of macro-evolutionary events than the classical models of population genetics. This is accomplished by placing increased emphasis on phenotypic parameters. While it is not possible to be completely successful in describing evolution in purely phenotypic terms, it seems that in many circumstances appropriate for natural populations this can be done. In the first section, Simpson's concept of adaptive zones is clarified by the construction of an adaptive topography for phenotypes, similar to Wright's adaptive topography for gene frequencies. This shows that for most phenotypic characters under natural selection, the evolution of the average phenotype in a population is always toward an adaptive zone of high mean fitness (W̄) in the phenotype space. Frequency-dependent selection may cause the average phenotype to evolve away from its adaptive zone, decreasing the mean fitness of individuals in the population; different types of frequency-dependent selection are classified as to whether or not they lead to such maladaptive evolution. A simple formula for estimating the minimum selective mortality per generation necessary to explain observed rates of phenotypic evolution is derived (assuming that genetic drift was not involved). The minimum mortality rates needed to explain observed rates of evolution in tooth characters of Tertiary mammals are very small, typically about one selective death per million individuals per generation. This leads to consideration of the hypothesis that these changes were caused by random genetic drift. Using statistical tests, it is found that the observed evolution of these mammalian tooth characters could have occurred by random genetic drift in rather large populations, with effective sizes in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Such statistical tests would be most interesting in cases where the adaptive significance of an evolutionary event is uncertain. Other hypotheses are also examined, including the existence of a selective threshold between two adaptive zones which might have been crossed by random genetic drift. The models indicate that if stabilizing selection is weak and an adaptive threshold is not very far away, random genetic drift between adaptive zones may be an important mechanism of evolution in populations of effective size in the hundreds or thousands. These results support the contention that random genetic drift may play a significant role in phenotypic evolution.},

abstract = {Species richness, Shannon information, and Simpson diversity are the three most commonly used nonparametric measures of species diversity. The sampling bias and variance of these measures differ greatly. Species richness may be seriously underestimated for even very large samples from a speciose community. The bias in species richness and Shannon information depend on unknown parameters of the species abundance distribution. An unbiased estimator exists only for Simpson diversity. Each of these measures is concave, so that the total diversity in a pooled set of communities exceeds (or equals) the average diversity within communities. The total diversity in a set of communities can therefore be partitioned into positive, additive components within and among communities, corresponding to $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity. Partitioning Simpson diversity corresponds to an analysis of variance. The proportion of the total diversity found within communities provides a natural measure of similarity among multiple communities. The expected similarity among multiple random samples from the same community depends on the number of samples and on the underlying measure of diversity.},

abstract = {Stochastic factors affecting the demography of a single population are analyzed to determine the relative risks of extinction from demographic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity, and random catastrophes. Relative risks are assessed by comparing asymptotic scaling relationships describing how the average time to extinction, T, increases with the carrying capacity of a population, K, under each stochastic factor alone. Stochastic factors are added to a simple model of exponential growth up to K. A critical parameter affecting the extinction dynamics is {\$}\backslashtilde r,{\$} the long-run growth rate of a population below K, including stochastic factors. If r̃ is positive, with demographic stochasticity T increases asymptotically as a nearly exponential function of K, and with either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes T increases asymptotically as a power of K. If r̃ is negative, under any stochastic demographic factor, T increases asymptotically with the logarithm of K. Thus, for sufficiently large populations, the risk of extinction from demographic stochasticity is less important than that from either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes. The relative risks of extinction from environmental stochasticity and random catastrophes depend on the mean and environmental variance of population growth rate, and the magnitude and frequency of catastrophes. Contrary to previous assertions in the literature, a population of modest size subject to environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes can persist for a long time, if r̃ is substantially positive.},

We asked whether, and over what period of time, meadow species maintain viable seeds in the soil, and by implication, whether the seed bank can contribute to restoration if conifers are removed. Seed bank composition, ground vegetation, and forest age structure were quantified for 209 samples representing a chronosequence of open meadow, young forest ({\textless} 75 years), and old forest (95 to {\textgreater} 200 years). The seed bank was substantial (44 taxa and 2332 germinants/ m(2)), but dominated by native ruderals (16 species comprising 71{\%} of germinants). Greater than 70{\%} of meadow species were absent from the seed bank. Thirteen meadow species accounted for 21{\%} of all germinants, but most of these were the dominant sedge, Carex pensylvanica Lam.. Seed density, richness, and composition showed weak relationships to forest age, and little resemblance to the ground vegetation, which changed markedly with forest development. Our results suggest that there is limited potential for recovery of most meadow species via the seed bank. Natural reestablishment of these species will require seed dispersal or gradual vegetative spread from existing openings, but competitive interactions with ruderal or forest species may limit recruitment or recovery.},

The number of temporary rivers and the severity of flow intermittence may be increasing in regions affected by climatic drying trends or water abstraction. Despite their abundance, temporary rivers have been historically neglected by ecologists. A recent increase in temporary-river research needs to be supported by new models that generate hypotheses and stimulate further research. In this article, we present three conceptual models that address spatial and temporal patterns in temporary-river biodiversity and biogeochemistry. 2. Temporary rivers are characterised by the repeated onset and cessation of flow, and by complex hydrological dynamics in the longitudinal dimension. Longitudinal dynamics, such as advancing and retreating wetted fronts, hydrological connections and disconnections, and gradients in flow permanence, influence biotic communities and nutrient and organic matter processing. 3. The first conceptual model concerns connectivity between habitat patches. Variable connectivity suggests that the metacommunity and metapopulation concepts are applicable in temporary rivers. We predict that aggregations of local communities in the isolated water bodies of temporary rivers function as metacommunities. These metacommunities may become longitudinally nested due to interspecific differences in dispersal and mortality. The metapopulation concept applies to some temporary river species, but not all. In stable metapopulations, rates of local extinction are balanced by recolonisation. However, extinction and recolonisation in many temporary-river species are decoupled by frequent disturbances, and populations of these species are usually expanding or contracting. 4. The second conceptual model predicts that large-scale biodiversity varies as a function of aquatic and terrestrial patch dynamics and water-level fluctuations. Habitat mosaics in temporary rivers change in composition and configuration in response to inundation and drying, and these changes elicit a range of biotic responses. In the model, aquatic biodiversity initially increases directly with water level due to increasing abundance of aquatic patches. When most of the channel is inundated and most aquatic patches are connected, further increases in aquatic habitat and connectivity cause aquatic biodiversity to decline due to community homogenisation and reduced habitat diversity. The predicted responses of terrestrial biodiversity to changes in water level are the inverse of aquatic biodiversity responses. 5. The third conceptual model represents temporary rivers as longitudinal, punctuated biogeochemical reactors. Advancing fronts carry water, solutes and particulate organic matter downstream; subsequent flow recessions and drying result in deposition of transported material in reserves such as pools and bar tops. Material processing is rapid during inundated periods and slower during dry periods. The efficiency of material processing is predicted to increase with the number of cycles of transport, deposition and processing that occur down the length of a temporary river. 6. We end with a call for conservation and resource management that addresses the unique properties of temporary rivers. Primary objectives for effective temporary river management are preservation or restoration of aquatic-terrestrial habitat mosaics, preservation or restoration of natural flow intermittence, and identification of flow requirements for highly valued species and processes.},

Bacterial community composition varied primarily by stream habitat and secondarily by lithology. Positive correlations were detected between bacterial community structure and nutrients, base cations, and dissolved organic carbon. Our results showed significant differences at the stream habitat, between epipssamon and epilithon bacterial communities, which we expected. Our results also showed significant differences at the landscape scale that could be related to different lithologies and associated stream biogeochemistry. These results provide insight into the bacterial community composition of little known and pristine arctic stream ecosystems and illustrate how differences in the lithology, soils, and vegetation community of the terrestrial environment interact to influence stream bacterial taxonomic richness and composition.},

abstract = {As a dominant land use in urban ecosystems, residential yards impact water and other environmental resources. Converting thirsty lawns into alternative landscapes is one approach to water conservation, yet barriers such as cultural norms reinforce the traditional lawn. Meanwhile, the complex social and ecological implications of yard choices complicate programs aimed at changing grass and other yard features for particular purposes. In order to better understand individual landscape decisions, we qualitatively examined residents' rationales for their preferred yard types in the desert metropolis of Phoenix, Arizona. After briefly presenting landscape choices across two survey samples, the dominant reasons for preferences are discussed: appearance, maintenance, environment, recreation, microclimate, familiarity, and health/safety. Three broader analytical themes emerged from these descriptive codes: (1) residents' desires for attractive, comfortable landscapes of leisure encompassing pluralistic tastes, lifestyles, and perceptions; (2) the association of environmental benefits and impacts with different landscape types involving complex social and ecological tradeoffs; and (3) the cultural legacies evident in modern landscape choices, especially in terms of a dichotomous human-nature worldview among long-time residents of the Phoenix oasis. Given these findings, programs aimed at landscape change must recognize diverse preferences and rationalization processes, along with the perceived versus actual impacts and tradeoffs of varying yard alternatives.},

In this paper, we present a robust conceptualization of values, encompassing general life values, broad-based environmental orientations, and specific yard priorities, while comparatively examining how these influence residents' land-management practices. Coupling a social survey with observational field data in Phoenix, Arizona, we address how 1) diverse values affect residents' multifaceted landscaping practices, 2) yard structure impacts water and chemical applications, and 3) land management varies across distinctive geographic contexts. Overall, values were not strongly related to land management decisions. Of those that were significant, most were related to groundcover and herbicide use. Yet diverse environmental values influenced landscaping practices in varying and complex ways. In addition, the historic and socioeconomic setting of neighborhoods affect the extent of lawns and related management inputs, while heightened use of pesticides inrock-based, drought-tolerant yards challenges the notion of these lawn alternatives as an environmentally friendly and low maintenance choice.},

Given these strong ecological effects, are interactions with below-ground microbes also important for understanding natural selection on plant traits? • Here, we manipulated below-ground microbial communities and the soil moisture environment on replicated populations of Brassica rapa to examine how microbial community structure influences selection on plant traits and mediates plant responses to abiotic environmental stress. • In soils with experimentally simplified microbial communities, plants were smaller, had reduced chlorophyll content, produced fewer flowers, and were less fecund when compared with plant populations grown in association with more complex soil microbial communities. Selection on plant growth and phenological traits also was stronger when plants were grown in simplified, less diverse soil microbial communities, and these effects typically were consistent across soil moisture treatments. • Our results suggest that microbial community structure affects patterns of natural selection on plant traits. Thus, the below-ground microbial community can influence evolutionary processes, just as recent studies have demonstrated that microbial diversity can influence plant community and ecosystem processes.},

This paper explores the use of a global theory called "permanence" that indicates whether the bundary of a phase space is a repoller to orbits in the phase space. The theory is used to try to identify, at a qualitative level, the states to which solutions tend in the phase space of an arbitrary pool of species. We define a "permanent state" of the pool as a subset of the species that is permanent in its own right and uninvadable by any other species from the pool. A simple assembly rule for communities that stems from this is that no permanent state can be a subset of another. Data on coexistence of drosophilid species and als on that of cuckoodoves, although incomplete, are consistent with this rule. A method is given for finding the permanent states of pools of species with Lotka-Volterra dynamics. A FINIR},

abstract = {Studies of evolutionary responses to novel environments typically consider single species or perhaps pairs of interacting species. However, all organisms co-occur with many other species, resulting in evolutionary dynamics that might not match those predicted using single species approaches. Recent theories predict that species interactions in diverse systems can influence how component species evolve in response to environmental change. In turn, evolution might have consequences for ecosystem functioning. We used experimental communities of five bacterial species to show that species interactions have a major impact on adaptation to a novel environment in the laboratory. Species in communities diverged in their use of resources compared with the same species in monocultures and evolved to use waste products generated by other species. This generally led to a trade-off between adaptation to the abiotic and biotic components of the environment, such that species evolving in communities had lower growth rates when assayed in the absence of other species. Based on growth assays and on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of resource use, all species evolved more in communities than they did in monocultures. The evolutionary changes had significant repercussions for the functioning of these experimental ecosystems: communities reassembled from isolates that had evolved in polyculture were more productive than those reassembled from isolates that had evolved in monoculture. Our results show that the way in which species adapt to new environments depends critically on the biotic environment of co-occurring species. Moreover, predicting how functioning of complex ecosystems will respond to an environmental change requires knowing how species interactions will evolve.},

abstract = {The dictionary definition of a law is: "Generalized formulation based on a series of events or processes observed to recur regularly under certain conditions; a widely observable tendency". I argue that ecology has numerous laws in this sense of the word, in the form of widespread, repeatable patterns in nature, but hardly any laws that are universally true. Typically, in other words, ecological patterns and the laws, rules and mechanisms that underpin them are contingent on the organisms involved, and their environment. This contingency is manageable at a relatively simple level of ecological organisation (for example the population dynamics of single and small numbers of species), and re-emerges also in a manageable form in large sets of species, over large spatial scales, or over long time periods, in the form of detail-free statistical patterns - recently called 'macroecology'. The contingency becomes over- whelmingly complicated at intermediate scales, characteristic of community ecology, where there are a large number of case histories, and very little other than weak, fuzzy generalizations. These arguments are illustrated by focusing on examples of typical studies in community ecology, and by way of contrast, on the macroecological relationship that emerges between local species richness and the size of the regional pool of species. The emergent pattern illustrated by local vs regional richness plots is extremely simple, despite the vast number of contingent processes and interactions involved in its generation. To discover general patterns, laws and rules in nature, ecology may need to pay less attention to the 'middle ground' of community ecology, relying less on reductionism and experimental manipulation, but increasing research efforts into macroecolog},

Supervised learning was highly effective at determining which participant had taken a given shoe or phone sample, and a Bayesian method was able to determine which participant had taken each shoe sample based entirely on its similarity to the floor samples. Both shoe and phone samples taken by conference participants clustered into distinct groups based on location, though much more so when an unweighted distance metric was used, suggesting sharing of low-abundance microbial taxa between individuals inhabiting the same space.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Correlations between microbial community sources and sinks allow for inference of the interactions between humans and their environment.},

abstract = {Aim The extent to which bacterial communities exhibit biogeographic patterns in their distribution remains unclear. We examined the relative influence of factors including geographic distance, latitude, elevation and catchment land use on the distribution and taxon richness of stream bacterial communities across New Zealand. Location Bacterial communities were collected from biofilm growing on sub- merged rocks in 244 streams. Sample sites spanned a north–south gradient of over 970 km, an elevational gradient of c. 750m and were collected from a variety of catchment types across New Zealand. Methods We used automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, a DNA fin- gerprinting technique, to characterize the structure and taxon richness of each bacterial community. Key attributes relating to sample location, upstream catch- ment land use and a suite of additional environmental parameters were collected for every site using GIS procedures. Univariate correlations between measures of bacterial community structure and latitude, elevation and distance were examined. Variance partitioning was then used to assess the relative importance of purely spatial factors versus catchment land use and environmental attributes for deter- mining bacterial community structure and taxon richness. Results Bacterial taxon richness was related to the geographic location of the sample site, being significantly greater at latitudes closer to the equator and reduced at higher elevations.We observed distance decay patterns in bacterial community similarity related to geographic distance and latitudinal distance, but not to eleva- tional distance. Overall, however, bacterial community similarity and taxon rich- ness was more closely related to variability in catchment land use than to climatic variability or geographic location. Main conclusion Our data suggest that stream biofilm communities across New Zealand are more influenced by catchment land use attributes than by dispersal limitation. Keywords},

abstract = {In ecological field surveys, observations are gathered at different spatial locations. The purpose may be to relate biological response variables (e.g., species abundances) to explanatory environmental variables (e.g., soil characteristics). In the absence of prior knowledge, ecologists have been taught to rely on systematic or random sampling designs. If there is prior knowledge about the spatial patterning of the explanatory variables, obtained from either previous surveys or a pilot study, can we use this information to optimize the sampling design in order to maximize our ability to detect the relationships between the response and explanatory variables? The specific questions addressed in this paper are: a) What is the effect (type I error) of spatial autocorrelation on the statistical tests commonly used by ecologists to analyse field survey data? b) Can we eliminate, or at least minimize, the effect of spatial autocorrelation by the design of the survey? Are there designs that provide greater power for surveys, at least under certain circumstances? c) Can we eliminate or control for the effect of spatial autocorrelation during the analysis? To answer the last question, we compared regular regression analysis to a modified t-test developed by Dutilleul for correlation coefficients in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Replicated surfaces (typically, 1000 of them) were simulated using different spatial parameters, and these surfaces were subjected to different sampling designs and methods of statistical analysis. The simulated surfaces may represent, for example, vegetation response to underlying environmental variation. This allowed us 1) to measure the frequency of type I error (the failure to reject the null hypothesis when in fact there is no effect of the environment on the response variable) and 2) to estimate the power of the different combinations of sampling designs and methods of statistical analysis (power is measured by the rate of rejection of the null hypothesis when an effect of the environment on the response variable has been created). Our results indicate that: 1) Spatial autocorrelation in both the response and environmental variables affects the classical tests of significance of correlation or regression coefficients. Spatial autocorrelation in only one of the two variables does not affect the test of significance. 2) A broad-scale spatial structure present in data has the same effect on the tests as spatial autocorrelation. When such a structure is present in one of the variables and autocorrelation is found in the other, or in both, the tests of significance have inflated rates of type I error. 3) Dutilleul's modified t-test for the correlation coefficient, corrected for spatial autocorrelation, effectively corrects for spatial autocorrelation in the data. It also effectively corrects for the presence of deterministic structures, with or without spatial autocorrelation. The presence of a broad-scale deterministic structure may, in some cases, reduce the power of the modified t-test},

abstract = {Beta diversity can be measured in different ways. Among these, the total variance of the community data table Y can be used as an estimate of beta diversity. We show how the total variance of Y can be calculated either directly or through a dissimilarity matrix obtained using any dissimilarity index deemed appropriate for pairwise comparisons of community composition data. We addressed the question of which index to use by coding 16 indices using 14 properties that are necessary for beta assessment, comparability among data sets, sampling issues and ordination. Our comparison analysis classified the coefficients under study into five types, three of which are appropriate for beta diversity assessment. Our approach links the concept of beta diversity with the analysis of community data by commonly used methods like ordination and anova. Total beta can be partitioned into Species Contributions (SCBD: degree of variation of individual species across the study area) and Local Contributions (LCBD: comparative indicators of the ecological uniqueness of the sites) to Beta Diversity. Moreover, total beta can be broken up into within- and among-group components by manova, into orthogonal axes by ordination, into spatial scales by eigenfunction analysis or among explanatory data sets by variation partitioning.},

abstract = {The spatial heterogeneity of populations and communities plays a central role in many ecological theories, for instance the theories of succession, adaptation, maintenance of species diversity, community stability, competition, predator-prey interactions, parasitism, epidemics and other natural catastrophes, ergoclines, and so on. This paper will review how the spatial structure of biological populations and communities can be studied. We first demonstrate that many of the basic statistical methods used in ecological studies are impaired by autocorrelated data. Most if not all environmental data fall in this category. We will look briefly at ways of performing valid statistical tests in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Methods now available for analysing the spatial structure of biological populations are described, and illustrated by vegetation data. These include various methods to test for the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the data: univariate methods (all-directional and two-dimensional spatial correlograms, and two- dimensional spectral analysis), and the multivariate Mantel test and Mantel correlogram; other descrip- tive methods of spatial structure: the univariate variogram, and the multivariate methods of clustering with spatial contiguity constraint; the partial Mantel test, presented here as a way of studying causal models that include space as an explanatory variable; and finally, various methods for mapping ecological variables and producing either univariate maps (interpolation, trend surface analysis, kriging) or maps of truly multivariate data (produced by constrained clustering). A table shows the methods classified in terms of the ecological questions they allow to resolve. Reference is made to available computer programs. Introduction},

abstract = {This paper examines how to obtain species biplots in unconstrained or constrained ordination without resorting to the Euclidean distance [used in principal component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA)] or the chi-square distance [preserved in correspondence analysis (CA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)] which are not always appropriate for the analysis of community composition data. To achieve this goal, transformations are proposed for species data tables. They allow ecologists to use ordination methods such as PCA and RDA, which are Euclidean-based, for the analysis of community data, while circumventing the problems associated with the Euclidean distance, and avoiding CA and CCA which present problems of their own in some cases. This allows the use of the original (transformed) species data in RDA carried out to test for relationships with explanatory variables (i.e. environ- $\backslash$nmental variables, or factors of a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model); ecologists can then draw biplots displaying the relationships of the species to the explanatory variables. Another application allows the use of species data in other methods of multivariate data analysis which optimize a least-squares loss function; an example is K-means partitioning.},

abstract = {Three markedly different models of multispecies competition- one mechanistic, one phenomenological, and one statistical- all predict that greater diversity increases the temporal stability of the entire community, decreases the temporal stability of individual populations, and increases community productivity. We define temporal stability as the ratio of mean abundance to its standard deviation. Interestingly, the temporal stability of entire communities is predicted to increase fairly linearly, without clear saturation, as diversity increases. Species composition is predicted to be as important as diversity in affecting community stability and productivity. The greater temporal stability of more diverse communities is causedby higher productivity at higher diversity (the "overyielding" effect), competitive interactions (the "covariance" effect), and statistical averaging (the "portfolio" effect). The relative contribution of each cause of temporal stability changes as diversity increases, but the net effect is that greater diversity stabilizes the community even though it destabilizes individual populations. This theory agrees with recent experiments and provides a degree of resolution to the diversitystabilitydebate: both sides of the longstanding debate were correct, but one addressed population stability and the other addressed community stability},

We first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

abstract = {The notion of 'community-wide character displacement' hypothesizes that locally co-existing sets of competing species should be less similar than expected when compared to random expectations from a broader regional species pool. Here I use a mechanistic approach to the niche concept to show how this expectation is dependent on the types of traits involved. I investigate how two different niche components, those that relate to species' requirements (or responses to environmental factors) versus those that relate to species' impacts (or effects on environmental factors), affect predictions about the similarity of locally co-existing species. In contrast with more conventional approaches that focus on species impacts, I focus on species responses to conclude that locally co-existing species should be more similar in such traits than expected on the basis of random asortment from a larger equilibrium regional biota. In addition, I explore the evolutionary implications of exceptions that might favour the co-existence of species with dissimilar traits (especially those that determine species' impacts on the environment) and conclude that these implications differ when species compete for shared resources, interact via shared predators, or interact via both mechanisms. The analysis developed in this paper shows that the co-existence of species that are more similar than expected by chance is not incompatible with the notion of strongly interacting species in saturated local communities near equilibrium.},

abstract = {I analyze a model of species interactions involving species that compete for a single resource and share a common "keystone predator" to study the "bottom-up" effects of productivity (potential carrying capacity of the resource) and the "top-down" effects of factors that affect the death rate of the predator on diversity, abundance, and distribution patterns in the resulting assemblages. The model predicts that coexistence of such species will occur at intermediate productivity (and at intermediate death rates on the top predator) and that superior resource exploiters will dominate at low productivity (and high predator death rates), whereas predator-resistant forms will dominate at high productivity (and low predator death rates). In this model, predator and resource densities are "buffered" against variation in productivity, but the densities of species at the intermediate trophic level are not. Given a large "pool" of potential such species, the model predicts a replacement series involving multiple pairs of species ranging from good resource exploiters to predator-resistant forms as productivity increases or predator death rates decrease. In such a case, coexistence is most likely among the more similar forms, but abundances of similar species are predicted to be negatively correlated. Furthermore, the overall density of organisms at all trophic levels is correlated with variation in productivity. Spatiotemporal heterogeneity modifies these predictions by allowing more than two species to coexist in the presence of a single resource and a single predator and by permitting positive covariation in the abundances of coexisting competitors as well. These models show the critical role of species compositional turnover in determining food web responses to bottom-up and top-down regulation by productivity and variation in predator death rates. The models also predict unimodal diversity versus productivity curves that depend in part on the degree of prey specificity by the top predator.},

abstract = {Population regulation of organisms is frequently viewed as being either by predation ("top-down" regulation) or by resource productivity ("bottom-up" regulation). However, these two types of regulation should ultimately balance, and the abundances of interacting organisms that result in any given environment should depend on the densities that can satisfy the balancing conditions. Here I use a simple model to examine interactions among consumers and two types of resources that differ in edibility. I use the model to predict the abundances of all three populations, which should result in environments that differ in consumer mortality (e.g., predation intensity) and resource productivity (e.g., nutrient levels). The model predicts that the effects of predation and productivity will depend strongly on the diet breadth of the consumers. I then test the predictions of the model in a field experiment on the plankton of an oligotrophic lake by manipulating fish predation and nutrient productivity. Finally, I compare these results with those of 46 other similar experiments and show the utility of the model in understanding the results of the experiments and the observed correlations of abundances of phytoplankton and zooplankton in natural lakes. The results of the experiments confirm that the effects of predators and nutrients on consumers (zooplankton) and resources (phytoplankton) predicted by the model differ when the consumer assemblage is dominated by a generalist herbivore (Daphnia) from those expected in the absence of such a generalist herbivore.},

abstract = {Trophic structure, the partitioning of biomass among trophic levels, is a major characteristic of ecosystems. Most studies of the forces that shape trophic structure emphasize either "bottom-up" or "top-down" regulation of populations and communities. Recent work has shown that these two forces are not mutually exclusive alternatives, but efforts to model their interaction still often yield unrealistic predictions. We focus on the problems involved with modeling situations in which community composition, including both the number of trophic levels and the species composition within a trophic level, can change. We review the development of these ideas, emphasizing in particular how compositional change can alter theoretical expectations about the regulation of trophic structure. A comparison of studies on the effects of predators and resource productivity in limnetic ecosystems reveals an intriguing disparity between the results of manipulative experiments and those of correlational studies. We suggest that this contrast is a result of the difference in the temporal scales operating in the two types of studies. Ecosystem-level variables may appear to approach an equilibrium in short-term press experiments; however, processes such as invasion and extinction of species will not have time to play out in most such experiments. We found that the responses of ecosystems to short-term experimental treatments involve less change in species composition than is found in natural communities that have diverged in response to local conditions over longer periods. We argue that the results of short-term experiments support the predictions of models in which the species pool does not change, whereas correlational studies among systems support theories that incorporate compositional change.},

However, as there are few quantitative methods for evaluating their joint effects, resolving this interaction is difficult. We develop a method that aims to evaluate the interaction between phylogenetic structure, historical biogeographic events and environmental filtering in driving species distributions in a large-scale metacommunity. Using freshwater zooplankton as a case study, we contrast the phylogenetic metacommunity structure of calanoid copepods and an ecologically similar but more vagile group, daphniids, in the northeastern US. We find that legacies of historical biogeographical events have strongly constrained calanoid distributions within this area, but that adaptation to different water chemistry and lake morphology drives the metacommunity structure of daphniids. Our findings show that biogeographic history and metacommunity processes jointly regulate community structure in these lakes and suggest that this also depends on factors that affect the colonization rate of different types of organisms.},

We explore what this concept of equivalence means in ecological communities, how such species may arise evolutionarily, and how the possibility of ecological equivalents relates to previous ideas about niche differentiation. We also show that the co-occurrence of ecologically similar or equivalent species is not incompatible with niche theory as has been supposed, because niche relations can sometimes favor coexistence of similar species. We argue that both evolutionary and ecological processes operate to promote the introduction and to sustain the persistence of ecologically similar and in many cases nearly equivalent species embedded in highly structured food webs.

Researchers are realizing that individual communities and ecosystems are not isolated from each other but rather that they are connected by exchanges of individuals (through dispersal) and materials (through spatial fluxes). From a conceptual perspective, there is a need to develop theories and hypotheses about the roles of these exchanges on different community and ecosystem attributes. Here we focus on the concept of metacommunities, to address how plankton communities are structured and how this may generate patterns of variation in planktonic ecosystems. Our premise is that planktonic systems can be understood in the framework of metacommunities and that the regulation of these metacommunities alter how they work as "complex adaptive systems." We hypothesize that connectivity through dispersal of local communities that are embedded in aquatic metacommunities show a range of dynamic behaviors related to their capacity to respond adaptively to environmental change.},

abstract = {The biodiversity of microbial communities has important implications for the stability and functioning of ecosystem processes. Yet, very little is known about the environmental factors that define the microbial niche and how this influences the composition and activity of microbial communities. In this study, we derived niche parameters from physiological response curves that quantified microbial respiration for a diverse collection of soil bacteria and fungi along a soil moisture gradient. On average, soil microorganisms had relatively dry optima (0.3 MPa) and were capable of respiring under low water potentials (-2.0 MPa). Within their limits of activity, microorganisms exhibited a wide range of responses, suggesting that some taxa may be able to coexist by partitioning the moisture niche axis. For example, we identified dry-adapted generalists that tolerated a broad range of water potentials, along with wet-adapted specialists with metabolism restricted to less-negative water potentials. These contrasting ecological strategies had a phylogenetic signal at a coarse taxonomic level (phylum), suggesting that the moisture niche of soil microorganisms is highly conserved. In addition, variation in microbial responses along the moisture gradient was linked to the distribution of several functional traits. In particular, strains that were capable of producing biofilms had drier moisture optima and wider niche breadths. However, biofilm production appeared to come at a cost that was reflected in a prolonged lag time prior to exponential growth, suggesting that there is a trade-off associated with traits that allow microorganisms to contend with moisture stress. Together, we have identified functional groups of microorganisms that will help predict the structure and functioning of microbial communities under contrasting soil moisture regimes.},

abstract = {The rate, timing, and quality of resource supply exert strong controls on a wide range of ecological processes. In particular, resource-mediated changes in microbial activity have the potential to alter ecosystem processes, including the production and respiration of organic matter. In this study, we used field experiments and simulation modeling to explore how aquatic heterotrophic bacteria respond to variation in resource quality (low vs. high) and resource schedule (pulse vs. press). Field experiments revealed that one-time pulse additions of resources in the form of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) caused short-lived ({\textless} or =48 h) peaks in bacterial productivity (BP), which translated into large differences across treatments: cumulative BP was twice as high in the pulse vs. press treatment under low resource quality, and five times as high under high resource quality. To gain a more mechanistic understanding of microbial productivity in variable resource environments, we constructed a mathematical model to explore the attributes of bacterial physiology and DOC supply that might explain the patterns observed in our field experiments. Model results suggest that the mobilization rate of refractory to labile carbon, an index of resource quality, was critical in determining cumulative differences in BP between pulse and press resource environments (BPPu:Pr ratios). Moreover, BPPu:Pr ratios were substantially larger when our model allowed for realistic changes in bacterial growth efficiency as a function of bacterial carbon consumption. Together, our field and modeling results imply that resource schedule is important in determining the flow of material and energy from microbes to higher trophic levels in aquatic food webs, and that the effects of resource quality are conditional upon resource schedule. An improved understanding of the effects of resource variability on microorganisms is therefore critical for predicting potential changes in ecosystem functioning in response to environmental change, such as altered DOC fluxes from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that terrestrial ecosystems are exporting more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to aquatic ecosystems than they did just a few decades ago. This "browning" phenomenon will alter the chemistry, physics, and biology of inland water bodies in complex and difficult-to-predict ways. Experiments provide an opportunity to elucidate how browning will affect the stability and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. However, it is challenging to obtain sources of DOC that can be used for manipulations at ecologically relevant scales. In this study, we evaluated a commercially available source of humic substances ("Super Hume") as an analog for natural sources of terrestrial DOC. Based on chemical characterizations, comparative surveys, and whole-ecosystem manipulations, we found that the physical and chemical properties of Super Hume are similar to those of natural DOC in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. For example, Super Hume attenuated solar radiation in ways that will not only influence the physiology of aquatic taxa but also the metabolism of entire ecosystems. Based on its chemical properties (high lignin content, high quinone content, and low C:N and C:P ratios), Super Hume is a fairly recalcitrant, low-quality resource for aquatic consumers. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that Super Hume can subsidize aquatic food webs through 1) the uptake of dissolved organic constituents by microorganisms, and 2) the consumption of particulate fractions by larger organisms (i.e., Daphnia). After discussing some of the caveats of Super Hume, we conclude that commercial sources of humic substances can be used to help address pressing ecological questions concerning the increased export of terrestrial DOC to aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems are connected to their surrounding watersheds through inputs of terrestrial-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM). The assimilation of this allochthonous resource by recipient bacterioplankton has consequences for food webs and the biogeochemistry of aquatic ecosystems. We used laboratory batch experiments to examine how variation in the source and supply (i.e. concentration) of DOM affects the productivity, respiration and growth efficiency of heterotrophic lake bacterioplankton. We created 6 different DOM sources from soils beneath near-monotypic tree stands in a temperate deciduous - coniferous forest. We then exposed freshwater microcosms containing a natural microbial community to a 1100 mu M supply gradient of each DOM source. Bacterial productivity (BP) and bacterial respiration (BR) increased linearly over the broad gradient, on average consuming 7{\%} of the standing pool of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Bacterial metabolism was also influenced by the chemical composition of the DOM source. Carbon-specific productivity declined exponentially with an increase in the carbon:phosphorus (C:P) ratio of the different DOM sources, consistent with the predictions of ecological stoichiometry. Together, our short-term laboratory experiments quantitatively describe the metabolic responses of freshwater bacterioplankton to variation in the supply of terrestrial-derived DOM. Furthermore, our results suggest that dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) content, which may be linked to the identity of terrestrial vegetation, is indicative of DOM quality and influences the productivity of freshwater bacterioplankton.},

abstract = {Biological invasions are becoming more common, yet the majority of introduced exotic species fail to establish viable populations in new environments. Current ecological research suggests that invasion success may be determined by properties of the native *ecosystem*, such as the supply rate of limiting nutrients (i.e. *trophic* state). We examined how *trophic* state influences invasion success by introducing an exotic zooplankter, Daphnia lumholtzi into native plankton communities in a series of experimental mesocosms exposed to a strong nutrient gradient. We predicted that the attributes of nutrient-enriched communities would increase the likelihood of a successful invasion attempt by D. lumholtzi. Contrary to our original predictions, we found that D. lumholtzi was often absent from mesocosms that developed under high nutrient supply rates. Instead, the presence of D. lumholtzi was associated with systems that had low nutrients, low zooplankton biomass, and high zooplank! ton species *diversity*. Using generalized estimating equations (GEE) and multivariate species data, we found that the presence-absence of D. lumholtzi could be explained by variations in zooplankton community structure, which was itself strongly influenced by nutrient supply rate. We argue that the apparent invasion success of D. luinholtzi was inhibited by the dominance of another cladoceran species, Chlydorus sphaericus. These results suggest that the interaction between *trophic* state and species identity influenced the invasion success of introduced D. lumholtzi.},

abstract = {We investigated the effects of water temperature on the exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi in a eutrophic Kansas reservoir (USA) and under laboratory conditions. Daphnia lumholtzi demonstrated a distinct late summer appearance in the reservoir at temperatures between 26 and 31 degreesC, which corresponded with steep declines in the densities of native Daphnia spp. Laboratory life-table experiments confirmed that D. lumholtzi performs well at elevated water temperatures. The intrinsic rate of increase (r), net reproductive rate (R-4), age at first reproduction, survivorship (l(x)) and molting rated all demonstrate that D. lumholtzi has a high temperature optimum between 20 and 30 degreesC. A comparison of literature-reported r-values indicates that the reproductive rate of D. lumholtzi is comparable with other Daphnia spp. between 20 and 25 degreesC, but also implies that D. lumholtzi may out-perform some Daphnia spp. at temperatures {\textgreater} 25 degreesC. Collectively, these results suggest that D. lumholtzi may be taking advantage of a late summer thermal niche, and that this invader may continue to colonize lakes and reservoirs in the southern US. However, life table data also indicate that D. lumholtzi performs poorly at temperatures {\textless} 10{\textless}degrees{\textgreater}C, which may inhibit the range expansion of this invader into northern waters},

abstract = {According to conventional wisdom, parasites and pathogens should evolve reduced virulence to their hosts, because more virulent parasites and pathogens are more likely to drive their hosts, and themselves, to extinction. But this view has been criticized for its reliance on group selection. According to an alternative perspective, selection will favor whatever level of virulence maximizes the rate of increase of the parasite or pathogen. This optimum virulence depends on the functional relationship between a parasite or pathogen's transmissibility and its effect on host mortality, with selection often favoring an intermediate degree of virulence. The thesis of this paper is that models in which intermediate levels of virulence are favored lead quite naturally to the further conclusion that parasites and pathogens should-up to a point-become less virulent over time, once the feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes are incorporated into the analysis. As a consequence of successive adaptations by the parasite or pathogen, the density of susceptible hosts is reduced, thereby altering the balance between selective forces so as to favor reduced virulence. However, the evolutionarily stable strategy that is achieved is bounded away from complete avirulence. We conclude that models in which intermediate virulence is favored do not necessarily contradict the conventional wisdom in the long run; in fact, these models provide a simple mechanistic explanation for the evolution of reduced virulence.},

Yet the conditions for the different outcomes of competition inferred from these models are most often interpreted in terms of resources. Here it is contended that the dynamics of resource supply and exploitation must be explicitly taken into account if these conditions are to be obtained in any accurate form. First, the distinction between perfectly substitutable, imperfectly substitutable and perfectly complementary resources is examined. This leads to an array of models intended to mirror interspecific exploitative competition for two resources for each category considered. Then, the conditions for the coexistence of the two competitors in each case are derived and presented with direct reference to the modes of resource use.},

abstract = {Temporally variable and reciprocal subsidies between ecosystems are ubiquitous. These spatial flows can generate a suite of direct and indirect effects in local and meta-ecosystems. The focus of most subsidy research, however, has been on the response of consumers in recipient ecosystems to constant subsidies over very short or very long time scales. We derive a meta-ecosystem model to explicitly consider the dynamic feedbacks between local ecosystems coupled through reciprocal pulsed subsidies. We predict oscillating reinforcing and dampening effects of reciprocal pulsed herbivore flows. Maximum reinforcing effects between reciprocal pulsed herbivore flows occur when these flows are in phase with the dynamics of neighboring predators. This prediction is robust to a range of pulse quantities and frequencies. Reciprocal pulsed herbivore subsidies lead to spatial and temporal variability in the strength of trophic cascades in local and meta-ecosystems but these cascading effects are the strongest when reciprocal pulsed subsidies are temporally concentrated. When predators demonstrate a behavioral response to prey abundance, reciprocal pulsed subsidies dampen the strength of local trophic cascades but lead to strong trophic cascades across local ecosystems. The timing of reciprocal pulsed subsidies is a critical component that determines the cascading effects of spatial flows. We show that spatial and temporal variabilities in resources and consumers can have a significant influence on the strength of cascading trophic interactions; therefore, our ability to detect and understand trophic cascades may depend on the scale of inquiry of ecological studies.},

This fundamental ecosystem attribute has long been recognized but the influence of this property on community regulation has not been investigated. We propose that this environmental attribute may explain variation in the strength of trophic cascades among ecosystems. Simply because of gravity, we should predict that systems with convex profiles receive low amounts of subsidies whereas systems with concave profiles act as spatial attractors, and receive high amounts of subsidies. The subsidy hypothesis states that ecosystems with high amounts of allochthonous inputs will experience the strongest trophic cascades. To test this hypothesis, we derive ecosystem models and investigate the effect of location and magnitude of subsidies on the strength of trophic cascades. Predictions from our models support the subsidy hypothesis and highlight the need to consider ecosystems as open to allochthonous flows.},

abstract = {Cascading trophic interactions mediated by consumers are complex phenomena, which encompass many direct and indirect effects. Nonetheless, most experiments and theory on the topic focus uniquely on the indirect, positive effects of predators on producers via regulation of herbivores. Empirical research in aquatic ecosystems, however, demonstrate that the indirect, positive effects of consumer-mediated recycling on primary producer stocks may be larger than the effects of herbivore regulation, particularly when predators have access to alternative prey. We derive an ecosystem model with both recipient- and donor-controlled trophic relationships to test the conditions of four hypotheses generated from recent empirical work on the role of consumer-mediated recycling in cascading trophic interactions. Our model predicts that predator regulation of herbivores will have larger, positive effects on producers than consumer-mediated recycling in most cases but that consumer-mediated recycling does generally have a positive effect on producer stocks. We demonstrate that herbivore recycling will have larger effects on producer biomass than predator recycling when turnover rates and recycling efficiencies are high and predators prefer local prey. In addition, predictions suggest that consumer-mediated recycling has the largest effects on primary producers when predators prefer allochthonous prey and predator attack rates are high. Finally, our model predicts that consumer-mediated recycling effects may not be largest when external nutrient loading is low. Our model predictions highlight predator and prey feeding relationships, turnover rates, and external nutrient loading rates as key determinants of the strength of cascading trophic interactions. We show that existing hypotheses from specific empirical systems do not occur under all conditions, which further exacerbates the need to consider a broad suite of mechanisms when investigating trophic cascades.},

abstract = {A persistent challenge in ecology is to tease apart the in- fluence of multiple processes acting simultaneously and interacting in complex ways to shape the structure of species assemblages. We implement a heuristic approach that relies on explicitly defining spe- cies pools and permits assessment of the relative influence of themain processes thought to shape assemblage structure: environmental fil- tering, dispersal limitations, and biotic interactions. We illustrate our approach using data on the assemblage composition and geographic distribution of hummingbirds, a comprehensive phylogeny and mor- phological traits. The implementation of several process-based species pool definitions in null models suggests that temperature—but not pre- cipitation or dispersal limitation—acts as the main regional filter of as- semblage structure. Incorporating this environmental filter directly into the definition of assemblage-specific species pools revealed an other- wise hidden pattern of phylogenetic evenness, indicating that biotic in- teractions might further influence hummingbird assemblage structure. Such hidden patterns of assemblage structure call for a reexamination of a multitude of phylogenetic- and trait-based studies that did not ex- plicitly consider potentially important processes in their definition of the species pool. Our heuristic approach provides a transparent way to explore patterns and refine interpretations of the underlying causes of assemblage structure.},

abstract = {Subway systems are indispensable for urban societies, but microbiological characteristics of subway aerosols are relatively unknown. Previous studies investigating microbial compositions in subways employed methodologies that underestimated the diversity of microbial exposure for commuters, with little focus on factors governing subway air microbiology, which may have public health implications. Here, a culture-independent approach unraveling the bacterial diversity within the urban subway network in Hong Kong is presented. Aerosol samples from multiple subway lines and outdoor locations were collected. Targeting the 16S rRNA gene V4 region, extensive taxonomic diversity was found, with the most common bacterial genera in the subway environment among those associated with skin. Overall, subway lines harbored different phylogenetic communities based on $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity comparisons, and closer inspection suggests that each community within a line is dependent on architectural characteristics, nearby outdoor microbiomes, and connectedness with other lines. Microbial diversities and assemblages also varied depending on the day sampled, as well as the time of day, and changes in microbial communities between peak and nonpeak commuting hours were attributed largely to increases in skin-associated genera in peak samples. Microbial diversities within the subway were influenced by temperature and relative humidity, while carbon dioxide levels showed a positive correlation with abundances of commuter-associated genera. This Hong Kong data set and communities from previous studies conducted in the United States formed distinct community clusters, indicating that additional work is required to unravel the mechanisms that shape subway microbiomes around the globe.},

abstract = {The problem of multiple scales permeates the study of ecological process and pattern, uniting aspects of space, time, and organizational complexity. In particular, it supports the maintenance of biological diversity, allowing for the magnification of underlying patterns of variation in the physical environment to create many resources from few, through the evolutionary diversification of species' niches and life histories. Specialization to particular stages of a successional gradient facilitates coexistence of multiple types in the presence of uncorrelated local disturbances, such as gap formation, which reinitiate successional sequences. Superimposed upon such successional dynamics are the effects of multiple stable states and multiple successional pathways (Levin 1976), which increase diversity even more. Multiple stable states more generally raise the possibility of sudden flips of systems from one stable configuration to another, and with such changes may come huge changes in the biotic composition. On larger spatial scales and longer time scales, these flips may become correlated resulting in the transformation of the landscape, or may result in sustained spatiotemporal mosaics of states. Instability at the local level may lead to the maintenance of biodiversity on broader scales. Finally, the ultimate scale mismatch involves that between the dynamics of natural systems and the cultural dynamics of human societies. Our ability to live sustainably in a global commons is dependent upon adjusting normative behavior, and tightening feedback loops more generally, so that individual actions serve the common good.},

abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an "observer" of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging from the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

abstract = {What explains the remarkable regularities in distribution and abundance of species, in size distributions of organisms, or in patterns of nutrient use? How does the biosphere maintain exactly the right conditions necessary for life as we know it? Gaia theory postulates that the biota regulates conditions at levels it needs for survival, but evolutionary biologists reject this explanation because it lacks a mechanistic basis. Similarly, the notion of self-organized criticality fails to recognize the importance of the heterogeneity and modularity of ecological systems. Ecosystems and the biosphere are complex adaptive systems, in which pattern emerges from, and feeds back to affect, the actions of adaptive individual agents, and in which cooperation and multicellularity can develop and provide the regulation of local environments, and indeed impose regularity at higher levels. The history of the biosphere is a history of coevolution between organisms and their environments, across multiple scales of space, time, and complexity.},

abstract = {The spatial component of environment, often neglected in modeling of ecological interactions, in general operates to increase species diversity. This arises due to the heterogeneity of the environment, but such heterogeneity can arise in an initially homogeneous environment due to what may be random initial events (e.g., colonization patterns), effects of which are magnified by species interactions. In this way, homogeneous environments may become heterogeneous and heterogeneous environments even more so. In patchy environments, distinct patches are likely to be colonized initially by different species, and thereby a kind of founder effect results whereby individual patches evolve along different paths simply as a consequence of initial colonization patterns. Species which would be unable to invade may nevertheless survive by establishing themselves early and will moreover be found in lower densities in other areas as overflow from their "safe" areas. Spatially continuous environments may evolve toward essentially patchy ones by this kind of process. Overall species richness is expected to be higher in patchy environments but to decrease as the ability of species to migrate becomes large. These results are due to patchiness per se and do not depend on the existence of several kinds of patches, a situation which will tend to reinforce these effects. Diversity is also increased in such environments with spatial extent due to the opportunities for fugitive-type spatio-temporal strategies. In these, local population oscillations provide the salvation for species which are for example competitively inferior or easy victims to predation but which can survive by superior migratory ability and (in patchy environments) talent for recolonization. Again, dependence is on spatial heterogeneity, in addition to temporal heterogeneity; again, this may be externally imposed or the result largely of internal processes. Some gross statistics for these processes, principally patch occupancy fractions, may prove useful for a simplified treatment of colonization-extinction equilibria, as in the approaches of Cohen (1970), Levins and Culver (1971), Horn and MacArthur (1972), and Slatkin (in preparation). For such considerations, however, one cannot assume independence of distributions; and the approach of Cohen (1970) and Slatkin (in preparation), which allows for consideration of covariance, is favored.},

abstract = {Ecological communities characteristically contain a wide diversity of species with important functional, economic and aesthetic value. Ecologists have long questioned how this diversity is maintained. Classic theory shows that stable coexistence requires competitors to differ in their niches; this has motivated numerous investigations of ecological differences presumed to maintain diversity. That niche differences are key to coexistence, however, has recently been challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity, which explains coexistence with the equivalence of competitors. The ensuing controversy has motivated calls for a better understanding of the collective importance of niche differences for the diversity observed in ecological communities. Here we integrate theory and experimentation to show that niche differences collectively stabilize the dynamics of experimental communities of serpentine annual plants. We used field-parameterized population models to develop a null expectation for community dynamics without the stabilizing effects of niche differences. The population growth rates predicted by this null model varied by several orders of magnitude between species, which is sufficient for rapid competitive exclusion. Moreover, after two generations of community change in the field, Shannon diversity was over 50 per cent greater in communities stabilized by niche differences relative to those exhibiting dynamics predicted by the null model. Finally, in an experiment manipulating species' relative abundances, population growth rates increased when species became rare--the demographic signature of niche differences. Our work thus provides strong evidence that species differences have a critical role in stabilizing species diversity.},

abstract = {Although plants and other sessile organisms often disperse in a prevailing direction, the ecological consequences of this are poorly understood. To explore patterns of plant diversity similar to those found in a California river system, I modeled perennial plant populations and communities occurring in a linear series of neighborhoods connected by dispersal, where dispersal occurs in a prevailing downstream direction. Simulations demonstrated that population size and species diversity correlated with dispersal and increased downstream, but only if fecundity and death rates were such that neighborhoods within the system depended on external propagule input for their persistence. Highly effective downstream dispersal and some upstream dispersal were also required. If these demographic and dispersal criteria were met, communities with intense competition and inhibition still developed downstream increases in diversity. Additionally, in such systems, directional dispersal could favor species coexistence since upstream neighborhoods provided a refuge for inferior competitors. The demographic and dispersal criteria were relaxed for systems recovering from scattered source populations following disturbance. I conclude that directional dispersal may be a key determinant of species coexistence and patterns of diversity in severely propagule-limited systems.},

High persister (hip) mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are selected in patients with cystic fibrosis. Similarly, hip mutants of Candida albicans are selected in patients with an oral thrush biofilm. These observations suggest that persisters may be the main culprit responsible for the recalcitrance of chronic infectious disease to antimicrobial therapy. Screening knockout libraries has not produced mutants lacking persisters, indicating that dormancy mechanisms are redundant. Toxin/antitoxin (TA) modules are involved in persister formation in Escherichia coli. The SOS response leads to overexpression of the TisB toxin and persister formation. TisB is a membrane-acting peptide that apparently sends cells into dormancy by decreasing the proton motive force and ATP levels. Stress responses may act as general activators of persister formation. Proteins required for maintaining persisters may represent realistic targets for discovery of drugs capable of effectively treating chronic infections.},

The history of this debate starts with Wynne-Edwards' arguments for group selection, and Hamilton's explantation of social behaviour in terms of the inclusive fitness of individuals. Hamilton's approach differs from the gene-centred approach pioneered by Williams and Dawkins, although both the problem and its solution are essentially the same. The choice of approach depends on conceptual and mathematical simplicity, and on one's attitude to the causal efficacy of genes. The problem of selection on units above the species level is discussed. Today, we are in the main concerned with cases in which selection acts simultaneously at two levels. This is true of current research on intragenomic conflict and of the suggestion by Maynard Smith and Szathm{\'{a}}ry that in the major transitions in evolution, entities that were capable of independent replication before the transition can only replicate as part of a larger whole after it.},

abstract = {1. We intensively sampled 16 western Oregon streams to characterize: (1) the variability in macroinvertebrate assemblages at seven spatial scales; and (2) the change in taxon richness with increasing sampling effort. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) model calculated spatial variance components for taxon richness, total density, percent individuals of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT), percent dominance and Shannon diversity. 2. At the landscape level, ecoregion and among-streams components dominated variance for most metrics, accounting for 43–72{\%} of total variance. However, ecoregion accounted for very little variance in total density and 36{\%} of the variance was attributable to differences between streams. For other metrics, variance components were more evenly divided between stream and ecoregion effects. 3. Within streams, approximately 70{\%} of variance was associated with unstructured local spatial variation and not associated with habitat type or transect position. The remaining variance was typically split about evenly between habitat and transect. Sample position within a transect (left, centre or right) accounted for virtually none of the variance for any metric. 4. New taxa per stream increased rapidly with sampling effort with the first four to eight Surber samples (500–1000 individuals counted), then increased more gradually. After counting more than 50 samples, new taxa continued to be added in stream reaches that were 80 times as long as their mean wetted width. Thus taxon richness was highly dependent on sampling effort, and comparisons between sites or streams must be normalized for sampling effort. 5. Characterization of spatial variance structure is fundamental to designing sampling programmes where spatial comparisons range from local to regional scales. Differences in metric responses across spatial scales demonstrate the importance of designing sampling strategies and analyses capable of discerning differences at the scale of interest.},

abstract = {There have been few recent studies demonstrating a definitive association between the transmission of airborne infections and the ventilation of buildings. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 and current concerns about the risk of an avian influenza (H5N1) pandemic, have made a review of this area timely. We searched the major literature databases between 1960 and 2005, and then screened titles and abstracts, and finally selected 40 original studies based on a set of criteria. We established a review panel comprising medical and engineering experts in the fields of microbiology, medicine, epidemiology, indoor air quality, building ventilation, etc. Most panel members had experience with research into the 2003 SARS epidemic. The panel systematically assessed 40 original studies through both individual assessment and a 2-day face-to-face consensus meeting. Ten of 40 studies reviewed were considered to be conclusive with regard to the association between building ventilation and the transmission of airborne infection. There is strong and sufficient evidence to demonstrate the association between ventilation, air movements in buildings and the transmission/spread of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox and SARS. There is insufficient data to specify and quantify the minimum ventilation requirements in hospitals, schools, offices, homes and isolation rooms in relation to spread of infectious diseases via the airborne route. PRACTICAL IMPLICATION: The strong and sufficient evidence of the association between ventilation, the control of airflow direction in buildings, and the transmission and spread of infectious diseases supports the use of negatively pressurized isolation rooms for patients with these diseases in hospitals, in addition to the use of other engineering control methods. However, the lack of sufficient data on the specification and quantification of the minimum ventilation requirements in hospitals, schools and offices in relation to the spread of airborne infectious diseases, suggest the existence of a knowledge gap. Our study reveals a strong need for a multidisciplinary study in investigating disease outbreaks, and the impact of indoor air environments on the spread of airborne infectious diseases.},

Undisturbed humid terrestrial ecosystems develop tight cycles and tend not to be leaky, but with disturbance losses of water, nutrients, and particulate matter are increased. Eutrophication in downstream aquatic ecosystems may be accelerated by these inputs in addition to the well-known eutrophication effects of urban-industrial wastes. Movement of some air-borne pollutants from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems is increasing and must be considered as a factor influencing aquatic ecosystems.

Overall, streamwater chemistry was very similar during these two periods, but fall median concentrations were consistently higher than spring values, except for ANC, pH, NO3 − and PO4 3−, which had lower values in fall. Median concentrations for NH4 + were approximately the same in spring and fall. Stream chemistry varied throughout the Hubbard Brook Valley by elevation, channel length, drainage area and type of drainage, but most of the variability in stream chemistry was subtle and relatively small. Overall, there were relatively large (two- to 10-fold) changes in chemistry with longitudinal distance of wetted channel, elevation and/or size of drainage area in some streams and for some elements (e.g., H+, Al n+, DOC), but other chemical concentrations changed relatively little (e.g., Cl−, dissolved Si). The main Hubbard Brook, a fifth-order stream at the mouth of the Valley, was remarkably constant in chemistry throughout its length, except where human disturbance near the mouth changed the chemistry. Differences in vegetation, geologic substrates and wetland areas were related to changes in pattern of streamwater chemistry throughout the Valley.},

abstract = {The influence of inlet bacteria on the assemblage composition of bacterioplankton was investigated in two Swedish forest lakes of different hydraulic retention time. Assemblage composition of the bacteria in lakes and running waters was determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified 16S rDNA. The amount of bacterial cells imported via the inlets in relation to bacterioplankton cells produced in the epilimnion of the lakes was also determined. In the lake with short retention time (theoretical hydraulic retention time of 0.3 yr) the lake bacterioplankton assemblage largely resembled the riverine assemblages, although the extent of similarity varied among inlets, depending on water flow. In the lake with long retention time (theoretical hydraulic retention time of 10 yr) the bacterioplankton assemblage in the lake had low similarity to the inlet assemblages. The degree of similarity between inlets and lakes was well correlated to the amount of imported cells. Thus, our data suggest that import of inlet bacteria could have a large effect on the composition of lake bacterioplankton assemblages and that hydrological factors determined the magnitude of this effect. Since short hydraulic retention times are very common in lakes in the boreal zone, input of allochthonous bacteria can be one major factor influencing bacterioplankton assemblage composition in boreal lakes.},

abstract = {We hypothesized that habitats differing in water flow regime would differ in bacterial function either because of differences in the local environment, in bacterial community composition (BCC), or in the mechanism shaping BCC (community assembly). In 20 lakes and 17 inlet streams BCC was analyzed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of the gene coding for 16S ribosomal RNA, and bacterial function was estimated as bacterial production rate (BP, measured as leucine incorporation) per content of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (BP : DOC). BCC in both lakes and streams appeared to be shaped by local environmental forces (i.e., species sorting according to metacommunity theory), but not by massive introduction of cells from the drainage area (mass effect). BP : DOC was lower in streams than in lakes, which appeared to be both because of differences in BCC and environment between lakes and streams, independent of each other. We found no support for an effect of water flow regime in itself (i.e., cell dispersal rate) causing the lower functionality of the streams. In streams, BP : DOC was correlated to both BCC and environment, independent of each other, while in lakes function could not be explained by either BCC or environment. The greater environmental variability among our streams than among our lakes may be the cause for the stronger BCC-function coupling in our streams, since smaller environmental variation among our lakes would allow a greater functional redundancy.},

abstract = {The classical view states that microbial biogeography is not affected by dispersal barriers or historical events, but only influenced by the local contemporary habitat conditions (species sorting). This has been challenged during recent years by studies suggesting that also regional factors such as mass effect, dispersal limitation and neutral assembly are important for the composition of local bacterial communities. Here we summarize results from biogeography studies in different environments, i.e. in marine, freshwater and soil as well in human hosts. Species sorting appears to be the most important mechanism. However, this result might be biased since this is the mechanism that is easiest to measure, detect and interpret. Hence, the importance of regional factors may have been underestimated. Moreover, our survey indicates that different assembly mechanisms might be important for different parts of the total community, differing, for example, between generalists and specialists, and between taxa of different dispersal ability and motility. We conclude that there is a clear need for experimental studies, first, to clearly separate regional and local factors in order to study their relative importance, and second, to test whether there are differences in assembly mechanisms depending on different taxonomic or functional groups.},

Using plasticine models in the field, we show that the light coat color of deer mice that recently colonized the light-colored soil of the Nebraska Sand Hills provides a strong selective advantage against visually hunting predators. Color variation in an admixed population suggests that this light Sand Hills phenotype is composed of multiple traits. We identified distinct regions within the Agouti locus associated with each color trait and found that only haplotypes associated with light trait values have evidence of selection. Thus, local adaptation is the result of independent selection on many mutations within a single locus, each with a specific effect on an adaptive phenotype, thereby minimizing pleiotropic consequences.},

Microbial invasions by viruses, bacteria, fungi and protists occur worldwide but are much harder to detect than invasions by macroorganisms. Invasive microbes have the potential to significantly alter community structure and ecosystem functioning in diverse terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Consequently, increased attention is needed on non-pathogenic invasive microbes, both free-living and symbiotic, and their impacts on communities and ecosystems. Major unknowns include the characteristics that make microbes invasive and properties of the resident communities and the environment that facilitate invasions. A comparison of microbial invasions with invasions of macroorganisms should provide valuable insights into general principles that apply to invasions across all domains of life and to taxon-specific invasion patterns. Invasive microbes appear to possess traits thought to be common in many invasive macroorganisms: high growth rate and resource utilization efficiency, and superior competitive abilities. Invading microorganisms are often similar to native species, but with enhanced performance traits, and tend to spread in lower diversity communities. Global change can exacerbate microbial invasions; therefore, they will likely increase in the future.},

abstract = {Aim: Dendritic ecological networks (DENs), such as river systems, combine features that challenge the traditional conceptual views and empirical approaches applied to metacommunities. As a result of their dendritic branching geometry and stream flow directionality, they are strongly hierarchical and asymmetrical. We analysed the metacommunity structure of benthic diatoms in a large-scale river system with the aim of evaluating the importance of potential causal influences. Furthermore, we hypothesized that metacommunities of diatoms that are strongly attached to their substrata show a different spatial structure than metacommunities of other, more weakly attached diatoms. Location: The study was carried out in the Dong River, a 32,275 km2 subtropical river network located in southern China. Methods: We surveyed benthic diatom communities during three seasons (dry, intermediate and wet). Using partial redundancy analysis, we partitioned community variation among environmental models and different spatial eigenfunction models to evaluate the influence of alternative dispersal pathways (overland versus water course dispersal), stream directionality, man-made dams and diatom functional traits on diatom metacommunity structure. Results: Models based on hydrological connections and water directionality represent spatial patterns better than overland distances, suggesting that the dynamics of benthic diatom metacommunities are mainly confined to the river network and influenced by the prevailing water flow. We found significant effects of man-made dams on the spatial structure of important limnological variables and diatom metacommunity structure. The metacommunity of strongly attached diatoms also showed a weaker signature of flow directionality than that of other growth forms, especially in seasons with high water levels. Main conclusions: We conclude that the consideration of among-site connectivity, flow directionality and species traits is key to a better understanding of the spatial ecology of passively dispersing microbial organisms in river systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Cells that reside within a community can cooperate and also compete with each other for resources. It remains unclear howthese opposing interactions are resolved at the population level. Hereweinvestigate such an internal conflict within a microbial (Bacillus subtilis) biofilm community: cells in the biofilm periphery not only protect interior cells from external attack but also starve them through nutrient consumption. We discover that this conflict between protection and starvation is resolved through emergence of long-range metabolic co-dependence between peripheral and interior cells. As a result, biofilm growth halts periodically, increasing nutrient availability for the sheltered interior cells. We show that this collective oscillation in biofilm growth benefits the community in the event of a chemical attack. These findings indicate that oscillations support population-level conflict resolution by coordinating competing metabolic demands in space and time, suggesting new strategies to control biofilm growth.

abstract = {Landscape connectivity has been shown to alter community assembly and its consequences. Here we examine how strong, sudden changes in connectivity may affect community assembly by conducting experiments on the effects of "community mixing," situations where previously isolated communities become completely connected with consequent community reorganization. Previous theory indicates that assembly history dictates the outcome of mixing: mixing randomly assembled communities leads to a final community with random representation from the original communities, while mixing communities that were assembled via a long history of colonizations and extinctions leads to strong asymmetry, with one community dominating the other. It also predicts that asymmetry should be stronger in the presence of predators in the system. We experimentally tested and explored this theory by mixing aquatic microcosms inhabited by a complex food web of heterotrophic protists, and algae. Our results confirm the prediction that long assembly history can produce asymmetry under mixing and suggest these dynamics could be important in natural systems. However, in contrast to previous theory we also found asymmetry weaker under mixing of communities with more complex trophic structure.},

abstract = {One of the simplest hypotheses used to explain species coexistence is the competition-colonization trade-off, that is, species can stably coexist in a landscape if they show a trade-off between competitive and colonization abilities. Despite extensive theory, the dynamics predicted to result from competition-colonization trade-offs are largely untested. Landscape change, such as habitat destruction, is thought to greatly influence coexistence under competition-colonization dynamics, although there is no formal test of this prediction. Here we present the first illustration of competition-colonization dynamics that fully transposes theory into a controlled experimental metacommunity of two Pseudomonas bacterial strains. The competition-colonization dynamics were achieved by directly manipulating trade-off strength and colonization rates to generate the full range of coexistence conditions and responses to habitat destruction. Our study successfully generates competition-colonization dynamics matching theoretical predictions, and our results further reveal a negative relationship between diversity and productivity when scaling up to entire metacommunities.},

abstract = {Ecological communities do not spring into existence overnight, but develop during the process we call assembly. As in other complex systems, random assemblies may generate surprising patterns. In previous models, sequential invasion and extinction moved successive species mixes toward a persistent one. Other species present in the pool could not invade this persistent mix. Chance events early in the assembly produced persistent mixes of different compositions. Most model species survived somewhere by belonging to one or more of these different persistent mixes. We show that with more rapid invasion, communities move through complex cycles of composition, where each species gets its turn. These complementary views offer insights into the diversity of natural communities. Importantly, they have practical implications for those attempting to restore diversity to damaged ecosystems},

Here, we review empirical approaches to metacommunities, both observational and experimental, pertaining to how well they relate to and test theoretical metacommunity paradigms and how well they capture the realities of natural ecosystems. First, we show that the species-sorting and mass-effects paradigms are the most commonly tested and supported paradigms. Second, the dynamics observed can often be ascribed to two or more of the four non-exclusive paradigms. Third, empirical approaches relate only weakly to the concise assumptions and predictions made by the paradigms. Consequently, we suggest major avenues of improvement for empirical metacommunity approaches, including the integration across theoretical approaches and the incorporation of evolutionary and meta-ecosystem dynamics. We hope for metacommunity ecology to thereby bridge existing gaps between empirical and theoretical work, thus becoming a more powerful framework to understand dynamics across ecosystems.},

In fact, populations of genetically identical B. subtilis comprise numerous distinct cell types. In addition to spores, cells can become genetically competent, motile, produce extracellular matrix or degradative enzymes, or secrete toxins that allow them to cannibalize their neighbors. Many of the cell fates listed above appear to be mutually exclusive. In this review, we discuss how individual cells within a population control their gene expression to ensure that proper regulation of differentiation occurs. These different cell fates are regulated by an intricate network that relies primarily on the activity of three major transcriptional regulators: Spo0A, DegU, and ComK. While individual cells must choose distinct cell fates, the population as a whole exhibits a spectrum of phenotypes whose diversity may increase fitness.},

Temporal overlap and difference between consumer efficiencies play roles that are in general qualitatively similar to those of niche overlap and difference between carrying capacities in the classical theory of competition in a constant environment.

The form of these curves has been interpreted as evidence for or against "community saturation" due to species interactions. This interpretation, however, is unwarranted. Using the concepts of alpha, beta and gamma diversity, I show that local-regional richness curves are determined by the way total diversity is partitioned between its alpha and beta components, which itself is a matter of scale. Changing the scale of the local community amounts to changing the scale at which the heterogeneity of the interactions between organisms and their environment manifests itself, and hence the balance between alpha and beta diversity. Community saturation may occur because of physical limitations, but there are no theoretical grounds for the belief that species interactions set an absolute upper limit to diversity at any scale. A distinction between different meanings of the concept of "saturation" is proposed to clarify this issue. I argue that the challenge now is to understand the relationship between alpha and beta diversity at multiple scales, and the processes that determine it.},

Coexistence turns out to hinge first and foremost on the difference between the time scales of resource and consumer dynamics. When the dynamics of the resource is discrete with a time step equal to or only slightly shorter than that of the consumers, temporal segregation of consumers does not make for their coexistence. Beyond a critical frequency of resource dynamics, coexistence becomes possible between completely temporally segregated species, and gets easier as resource dynamics gets more frequent (tending to continuity) and faster, and as the consumers are more efficient and more similar. When the time scale of resource dynamics is short enough, coexistence also becomes possible between species that overlap in time. However, there is a limiting amount of temporal overlap they can tolerate, which increases as their efficiency, their similarity, and resource availability increase. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {The paired source and sink concepts are used increasingly in ecology and Earth sciences, but they have evolved in divergent directions, hampering communication across disciplines. We propose a conceptual framework that unifies existing definitions, and review their most significant consequences for the various disciplines. A general definition of the source and sink concepts that transcends disciplines is based on net flows between the components of a system: a source is a subsystem that is a net exporter of some living or non-living entities of interest, and a sink is a net importer of these entities. Sources and sinks can further be classified as conditional and unconditional, depending on the intrinsic propensity of subsystems to either produce (source) or absorb (sink) a surplus of these entities under some (conditional) or all (unconditional) conditions. The distinction between conditional and unconditional sources and sinks, however, is strongly context dependent. Sources can turn into sinks, and vice versa, when the context is changed, when systems are subject to temporal fluctuations or evolution, or when they are considered at different spatial and temporal scales. The conservation of ecosystem services requires careful consideration of the source−sink dynamics of multiple ecosystem components. Our synthesis shows that source−sink dynamics has profound consequences for our ability to understand, predict, and manage species and ecosystems in heterogeneous landscapes.},

abstract = {There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem processes in changing environments, but the mechanisms that underlie this effect are still controversial and poorly understood. Here, we extend mechanistic theory of ecosystem stability in competitive communities to clarify the mechanisms underlying diversity-stability relationships. We first explain why, contrary to a widely held belief, interspecific competition should generally play a destabilising role. We then explore the stabilising effect of differences in species' intrinsic rates of natural increase and provide a synthesis of various potentially stabilising mechanisms. Three main mechanisms are likely to operate in the stabilising effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties: (1) asynchrony of species' intrinsic responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) differences in the speed at which species respond to perturbations, (3) reduction in the strength of competition. The first two mechanisms involve temporal complementarity between species, while the third results from functional complementarity. Additional potential mechanisms include selection effects, behavioural changes resulting from species interactions and mechanisms arising from trophic or non-trophic interactions and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that mechanistic trait-based approaches are key to predicting the effects of diversity on ecosystem stability and to bringing the old diversity-stability debate to a final resolution.},

abstract = {Independent species fluctuations are commonly used as a null hypothesis to test the role of competition and niche differences between species in community stability. This hypothesis, however, is unrealistic because it ignores the forces that contribute to synchronization of population dynamics. Here we present a mechanistic neutral model that describes the dynamics of a community of equivalent species under the joint influence of density dependence, environmental forcing, and demographic stochasticity. We also introduce a new standardized measure of species synchrony in multispecies communities. We show that the per capita population growth rates of equivalent species are strongly synchronized, especially when endogenous population dynamics are cyclic or chaotic, while their long-term fluctuations in population sizes are desynchronized by ecological drift. We then generalize our model to nonneutral dynamics by incorporating temporal and nontemporal forms of niche differentiation. Niche differentiation consistently decreases the synchrony of species per capita population growth rates, while its effects on the synchrony of population sizes are more complex. Comparing the observed synchrony of species per capita population growth rates with that predicted by the neutral model potentially provides a simple test of deterministic asynchrony in a community.},

Our model shows that the mixing rate between the source and sink resource populations has a dramatic influence on the outcome of competition. When there is a strict sink-source dependence, so that resource renewal in the sink is entirely dependent on the source, only exploitation competition decides which species can survive at a very small mixing rate. Increasing the flow rate basically amounts to increasing the role played by interference competition. If interspecific interference is very small, compared with intraspecific interference, increasing the mixing rate allows coexistence of many species, indeed, unlimited coexistence if the species' resource exploitation efficiencies are similar enough. If interspecific interference is significant and there is a trade-off between the exploitation and interference competitive abilities of two species, it is possible to have one species replacing the other along a gradient of increasing mixing rate, with either coexistence or alternative single-species equilibria at intermediate values of the mixing rate. It is also possible to have one species always outcompeting the other, or alternative single-species stable equilibria at large mixing rates. When the strict sink-source dependence is relaxed by allowing the resource to have a partly independent renewal-loss dynamics in the sink area, the variety of possible outcomes along a gradient of mixing rate is further increased. These outcomes are often strongly sensitive to the parameters of resource dynamics and interspecific interference competition. The implications of these results for biological conservation can be profound; detailed knowledge of interspecific interactions appears to be necessary to determine the effect of any land management that alters dispersal opportunities.

abstract = {Spatial flows of materials and organisms across ecosystem boundaries are ubiquitous. Understanding the consequences of these flows should be a basic goal of ecosystem science, and yet it has received scant theoretical treatment to date. Here, using a simple, open, nutrient-limited ecosystem model with trophic interactions, we explore theoretically how spatial flows affect the functioning of local ecosystems, how physical mass-balance constraints interact with biological demographic constraints in the regulation of this functioning, and how failure to consider these constraints explicitly can lead to models that are ecologically inconsistent. In particular, we show that standard prey-dependent models for trophic interactions may lead to implausible outcomes when embedded in an ecosystem context with appropriate mass flows and mass-balance constraints. Our analysis emphasizes the need for integration of population, community, and ecosystem perspectives in ecology and the critical consequences of assuming closed versus open systems.},

abstract = {Explaining the maintenance of high local species diversity in communities governed by competition for space has been a long-standing problem in ecology. We present a simple theoretical model to explore the influence of immigration from an external source on local coexistence, species abundance patterns, and ecosystem processes in plant communities. The model is built after classical metapopulation models but is applied to competition for space between individuals and includes immigration by a propagule rain and an extinction threshold for rare species. Our model shows that immigration can have a huge effect on local species diversity in competitive communities where competition for space would lead to the exclusion of all but one species if the community were closed. Local species richness is expected to increase strongly when immigration intensity increases beyond the threshold required for the successful establishment of one or a few individuals. Community structure and species relative abundances are also expected to change markedly with immigration intensity. Increasing immigration causes total space occupation by the community to increase but primary productivity on average to either decrease or stay constant with increasing diversity, depending on the relation between immigration and local reproduction rates. These results stress the need for a regional perspective to understand the processes that determine species diversity, species abundance patterns, and ecosystem functioning in local communities.},

abstract = {The potential consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functioning and services at local scales have received considerable attention during the last decade, but little is known about how biodiversity affects ecosystem processes and stability at larger spatial scales. We propose that biodiversity provides spatial insurance for ecosystem functioning by virtue of spatial exchanges among local systems in heterogeneous landscapes. We explore this hypothesis by using a simple theoretical metacommunity model with explicit local consumer-resource dynamics and dispersal among systems. Our model shows that variation in dispersal rate affects the temporal mean and variability of ecosystem productivity strongly and nonmonotonically through two mechanisms: spatial averaging by the intermediate-type species that tends to dominate the landscape at high dispersal rates, and functional compensations between species that are made possible by the maintenance of species diversity. The spatial insurance effects of species diversity are highest at the intermediate dispersal rates that maximize local diversity. These results have profound implications for conservation and management. Knowledge of spatial processes across ecosystems is critical to predict the effects of landscape changes on both biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services.},

abstract = {Ecologists are increasingly adopting an evolutionary perspective, and in recent years, the idea that closely related species are ecologically similar has become widespread. In this regard, phylogenetic signal must be distinguished from phylogenetic niche conservatism. Phylogenetic niche conservatism results when closely related species are more ecologically similar that would be expected based on their phylogenetic relationships; its occurrence suggests that some process is constraining divergence among closely related species. In contrast, phylogenetic signal refers to the situation in which ecological similarity between species is related to phylogenetic relatedness; this is the expected outcome of Brownian motion divergence and thus is necessary, but not sufficient, evidence for the existence of phylogenetic niche conservatism. Although many workers consider phylogenetic niche conservatism to be common, a review of case studies indicates that ecological and phylogenetic similarities often are not related. Consequently, ecologists should not assume that phylogenetic niche conservatism exists, but rather should empirically examine the extent to which it occurs.},

abstract = {Phosphate interacts with inorganic sediment particles through sorption reactions in streams. Collectively, this phosphorus (P) buffering mechanism can be an important determinant of soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations. If sorption reactions control SRP concentrations in a stream, then differences in sediment characteristics may cause spatial differences in SRP concentrations. This prediction was tested by examining sediment-buffering characteristics and spatial variation in SRP among reaches with distinct sediment composition (i.e., fine versus coarse particles) in two tributaries of Boulder Creek, a headwater stream in central Wisconsin. SRP concentrations were significantly lower and algal available P and P sorption capacity were significantly higher in the reach dominated by fine sediments. Although fine particles such as sand had the greatest P sorption capacity, no retention could be attributed to biotic processes, whereas over 50{\%} of P retention in coarse particles such as gravel could be linked to biotic uptake. Equilibrium P concentration (EPC₀) assays from different sediment fractions also indicate that biotic uptake is relatively unimportant in sand particles ( {\$}\backslashtext{\{}EPC{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}live{\}}{\}}{\$} 10 $\mu$g/L: {\$}\backslashtext{\{}EPC{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}killed{\}}{\}}{\$} 10 $\mu$g/L) but very important in gravel or larger particles ( {\$}\backslashtext{\{}EPC{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}live{\}}{\}}{\$} 10 $\mu$g/L: {\$}\backslashtext{\{}EPC{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}killed{\}}{\}}{\$} 80 $\mu$g/L). Thus, sediment influence on stream water P concentrations can shift predictably from abiotic sorption in reaches with fine particles to biotic retention in areas dominated by coarse sediments. Consequently, changes in sediment composition due to natural or anthropogenic disturbance have the potential to alter the type and strength of sediment-associated processes determining ambient stream P concentrations.},

Capillary GC coupled to selected-ion monitoring mass spectrometry (SIM-MS) of CuO oxidation products provides the high sensitivity and precision required for the identification and quantification of trace levels of lignin in seawater. The low blanks and quick cleanup of C18 cartridges support SPE for processing such samples. Comparison of SPE with other isolation procedures (direct dry-down and ultrafiltration) has shown that this method quantitatively recovers dissolved lignin and preserves its compositional parameters. The concentration and nature of dissolved organic matter appear to be primary factors that constrain the amount of water that should be processed to obtain quantitative and reproducible recoveries of dissolved lignin using SPE. Highest recoveries of dissolved lignin were obtained at low pH (1.5−4.0) with substantial decreases at pH {\textgreater} 4. Extraction efficiencies were independent of flow rate within a range of five to fifteen bed volumes per minute (50−150 mL min-1), and both refrigeration and freezing were appropriate long-term storage methods for processed cartridges prior to elution of retained dissolved lignin.},

Consequently, there remains uncertainty about how individual traits mediate dispersal and its ecological effects. Addressing this uncertainty is crucial for distinguishing neutral versus non-neutral drivers of community assembly. Neutral theory assumes that dispersal is stochastic and equivalent among species. This assumption can be rejected on principle, but common research approaches tacitly support the ‘neutral dispersal' assumption. Theory and empirical evidence that dispersal traits are under selection should be broadly integrated in community-level research, stimulating greater scrutiny of this assumption. A tighter empirical connection between the ecological and evolutionary forces that shape dispersal will enable richer understanding of this fundamental process and its role in community assembly.},

abstract = {Genetic data are often used to assess 'population connectivity' because it is difficult to measure dispersal directly at large spatial scales. Genetic connectivity, however, depends primarily on the absolute number of dispersers among populations, whereas demographic connectivity depends on the relative contributions to population growth rates of dispersal vs. local recruitment (i.e. survival and reproduction of residents). Although many questions are best answered with data on genetic connectivity, genetic data alone provide little information on demographic connectivity. The importance of demographic connectivity is clear when the elimination of immigration results in a shift from stable or positive population growth to negative population growth. Otherwise, the amount of dispersal required for demographic connectivity depends on the context (e.g. conservation or harvest management), and even high dispersal rates may not indicate demographic interdependence. Therefore, it is risky to infer the importance of demographic connectivity without information on local demographic rates and how those rates vary over time. Genetic methods can provide insight on demographic connectivity when combined with these local demographic rates, data on movement behaviour, or estimates of reproductive success of immigrants and residents. We also consider the strengths and limitations of genetic measures of connectivity and discuss three concepts of genetic connectivity that depend upon the evolutionary criteria of interest: inbreeding connectivity, drift connectivity, and adaptive connectivity. To conclude, we describe alternative approaches for assessing population connectivity, highlighting the value of combining genetic data with capture-mark-recapture methods or other direct measures of movement to elucidate the complex role of dispersal in natural populations.},

The spread of such introgression can occur even when hybrids have reduced Darwinian fitness, which decreases the frequency of hybrids due to low survival or reproduction through time. This paradox can be partially explained by spatial sorting, where genotypes associated with dispersal increase in frequency at the edge of expansion, fueling further expansion and allowing invasive hybrids to increase in frequency through space rather than time. Furthermore, because all progeny of a hybrid will be hybrids (i.e., will possess genes from both parental taxa), nonnative admixture in invaded populations can increase even when most hybrid progeny do not survive.

The algae were studied by phycologists and the animals by zoologists. Consequently, little attention was paid to the potential effects of either group on the distribution, abundance, morphology, or diversity of the other. Recent interest in plant-herbivore interactions has given us numerous studies of various aspects of algae-herbivore interactions-e.g. of factors affecting herbivore foraging (12, 19, 33, 39, 40, 45, 54, 56, 64, 69, 76-79, 81, 83, 84, 87, 93, 108, 110-112, 114, 125, 128-130, 132, 136, 146, 151); anti-herbivore defenses of algae (41, 58, 62, 91, 137, 145); effects of herbivores on the distribution, abundance, and morphology of individuals within algal popu- lations (3, 9, 10, 13-16, 18, 22, 34, 36, 38, 43, 44, 46, 51, 52, 61-63, 65, 71, 72, 74, 75, 82, 86, 88, 90-92, 94-97, 102, 104, 111, 115, 126, 127, 131, 132, 134, 137, 141-144, 147-150, 152, 154); effects of herbivores on succession and diversity within communities (15, 22, 36, 43, 53, 61, 71, 88, 92, 97, 106, 126, 134, 138, 150); and possible effects of herbivores on biogeographic patterns of algae (3, 7, 8, 44, 61, 90, 140). It is our purpose to provide a general framework to aid discussion of the interactions between marine plants and herbivores and to illustrate how they may be linked. Our hope is that in so doing, we may expose the numerous gaps in our knowledge, and, more importantly, show the utility of a unified approach to marine plant-herbivore interactions, thereby focusing future research efforts},

The predator Didinium nasutum is found to coexist in microcosms with its prey, Colpidium campylum. Prey are limited by the quantity of bacteria and nutrients available. Didinium proves to be an ineffective predator and is limited by the availability and/or quality of prey as food. Enrichment of this community with bacteria or nutrients results in the extinction of prey and starvation of the predator. Increasing diversity of the lower trophic level by adding alternative prey species destabilizes this community, also causing extinction. Stability depends here on the characteristics of the particular species serving as prey and not simply the diversity of species present.},

abstract = {One of the most ubiquitous phenomena of all natural populations is their variability in numbers in space and time. However, there are notable differences among populations in the way the population size fluctuates. One of the major challenges in population and community ecology is to explain and understand this variety and to find possible underlying rules that might be modified from case-to-case. Population variability also has a spatial component because fluctuations are often synchronized over relatively large distances. Recently, this has led to growing interest in how 'internal' (density-dependent) processes interact with 'external' factors such as environmental variability.},

abstract = {Metagenomics has revolutionized microbiological studies during the past decade and provided new insights into the diversity, dynamics, and metabolic potential of natural microbial communities. However, metagenomics still represents a field in development, and standardized tools and approaches to handle and compare metagenomes have not been established yet. An important reason accounting for the latter is the continuous changes in the type of sequencing data available, for example, long versus short sequencing reads. Here, we provide a guide to bioinformatic pipelines developed to accomplish the following tasks, focusing primarily on those developed by our team: (i) assemble a metagenomic dataset; (ii) determine the level of sequence coverage obtained and the amount of sequencing required to obtain complete coverage; (iii) identify the taxonomic affiliation of a metagenomic read or assembled contig; and (iv) determine differentially abundant genes, pathways, and species between different datasets. Most of these pipelines do not depend on the type of sequences available or can be easily adjusted to fit different types of sequences, and are freely available (for instance, through our lab Web site: http://www.enve-omics.gatech.edu/). The limitations of current approaches, as well as the computational aspects that can be further improved, will also be briefly discussed. The work presented here provides practical guidelines on how to perform metagenomic analysis of microbial communities characterized by varied levels of diversity and establishes approaches to handle the resulting data, independent of the sequencing platform employed. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Although regional and global models of nitrogen (N) cycling typically focus on nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is the dominant form of nitrogen export from many watersheds and thus the dominant form of dissolved N in many streams. Our understanding of the processes controlling DON export from temperate forests is poor. In pristine systems, where biological N limitation is common, N contained in recalcitrant organic matter (OM) can dominate watershed N losses. This recalcitrant OM often has moderately constrained carbon:nitrogen (C:N) molar ratios (approximately 25-55) and therefore, greater DON losses should be observed in sites where there is greater total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loss. In regions where anthropogenic N pollution is high, it has been suggested that increased inorganic N availability can reduce biological demand for organic N and therefore increase watershed DON losses. This would result in a positive correlation between inorganic and organic N concentrations across sites with varying N availability. In four repeated synoptic surveys of stream water chemistry from forested watersheds along an N loading gradient in the southern Appalachians, we found surprisingly little correlation between DON and DOC concentrations. Further, we found that DON concentrations were always significantly correlated with watershed N loading and stream water [NO3-] but that the direction of this relationship was negative in three of the four surveys. The C:N molar ratio of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in streams draining watersheds with high N deposition was very high relative to other freshwaters. This finding, together with results from bioavailability assays in which we directly manipulated C and N availabilities, suggests that heterotrophic demand for labile C can increase as a result of dissolved inorganic N (DIN) loading, and that heterotrophs can preferentially remove N-rich molecules from DOM. These results are inconsistent with the two prevailing hypotheses that dominate interpretations of watershed DON loss. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis, the indirect carbon control hypothesis, which recognizes that heterotrophic demand for N-rich DOM can keep stream water DON concentrations low when N is not limiting and heterotrophic demand for labile C is high.},

The changes include gradual increases in gene number, resulting from the retention of duplicate genes, and more abrupt increases in the abundance of spliceosomal introns and mobile genetic elements. We argue that many of these modifications emerged passively in response to the long-term population-size reductions that accompanied increases in organism size. According to this model, much of the restructuring of eukaryotic genomes was initiated by nonadaptive processes, and this in turn provided novel substrates for the secondary evolution of phenotypic complexity by natural selection. The enormous long-term effective population sizes of prokaryotes may impose a substantial barrier to the evolution of complex genomes and morphologies.},

Observations from the genomic databases for several eukaryotic species suggest that duplicate genes arise at a very high rate, on average 0.01 per gene per million years. Most duplicated genes experience a brief period of relaxed selection early in their history, with a moderate fraction of them evolving in an effectively neutral manner during this period. However, the vast majority of gene duplicates are silenced within a few million years, with the few survivors subsequently experiencing strong purifying selection. Although duplicate genes may only rarely evolve new functions, the stochastic silencing of such genes may play a significant role in the passive origin of new species.},

abstract = {Riparian cottonwood (Populus deltoides) forests form the one of the most extensive deciduous forest ecosystems in arid regions of the western United States. However, cottonwood populations are threatened by flow alteration and channel degradation caused by dams, water diversions, and groundwater pumping. We developed a stochastic, density-dependent, population model to (1) consolidate information concerning cottonwood population dynamics in a conceptual and analytical framework, (2) determine whether complex forest stand dynamics can be predicted from basic cottonwood vital rates and river hydrology, and (3) aid in planning prescribed floods by projecting how altered flow regimes might affect populations. The model describes how annual variation in the hydrograph affects cottonwood mortality (via floods and droughts) and recruitment (via scouring of new habitat and seedling establishment). Using parameter values for the undammed Yampa River in Colorado, we found that abundances of seedlings and Younger trees followed a boom-bust cycle driven by high flood mortalities while reproductive adult abundance followed a less erratic 5-15-yr periodicity driven by multiyear sequences of flows favorable to stand recruitment. Conversely, chance occurrences of multiple drought years eliminated cottonwood from up to 50{\%} of available habitat, providing opportunities for competing plant species to establish. By simulating flow alterations on the Yampa ranging from channelization (many floods/droughts) to damming (few floods/droughts), the model suggested that mature cottonwood forest should be most abundant near the observed natural flow regime. Model analysis also Suggested that flow regimes with high flood frequencies result in stable (albeit small) population sizes, while stable flows result in highly variable population sizes prone to local extinction.},

abstract = {It is well known that related species often differ in either habitat' or size, and thereby avoid competitive elimination. The way in which they differ is related to the specialized ways they have of using resources, which ways in turn control numbers of coexisting species and other aspects of the evolution of the comnmunity. The detailed reasons for these assertions are given in the following paragraphs.2 Briefly, the argument is as follows. Among species which specialize on a single uniform resource, only the most effective one will survive and that species will be found wherever the resource occurs, in abundance determined by the density of the resource. Other such pure specialist species will be found, one to a uniform resource; these will normally differ in morphology, but will not in general be affected by one another's distributions. On the other hand, species which specialize on a particular proportion of mixture of two or more particular resources will be found only where their favored proportion is found, and will be replaced by other species in other habitats where the proportion of the mixture changes to one on which the new species are more effective. Of this mixed-resource type of species there can be as many3 as there are proportions of the resources which can be counted on from season to season-i.e., very many in stable climates and fewer in unpredictable climates.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes factors which determine the extent of density compensation on islands; i.e., is the summed population density of all species on an island equal to the summed mainland density? A graphical analysis allows quantitative comparisons of density compensation studies. Two hypotheses which are generally applicable predict the extent of density compensation on islands: (1) Niche theory predicts that summed population densities should be low if island species number is low. (2) The "habitat appropriateness" hypothesis predicts that summed population densities should be low if island populations occupy unfamiliar habitat. Both hypotheses successfully explain variability in the extent of density compensation on islands. Relative to the mainland, summed population densities on islands are high when islands support a large number of species and those species occupy familiar habitats. Summed population densities on islands are low when islands support few species and those species occupy novel habitats. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1980 Springer},

abstract = {1. For plant invaders, being different is often equated with being successful, yet the mechanistic connection remains unclear. 2. Classic niche theory predicts that invaders with niches distinct from the native flora should coexist with little interaction with native species, yet such invaders often have substantial impacts. Meanwhile, invaders that overlap in niche space with native species should either be repelled or dominate, yet these invaders often naturalize with little effect. Such discrepancies between theory and observation raise questions about how species differences influence invader establishment and impact. 3. Here, we review these issues in light of recent work on coexistence theory, which shows how niche and fitness differences between natives and invaders interact to determine invasion outcomes. We show how successful invader establishment depends on either a fitness advantage or niche difference from resident species, but that only the former allows invaders to become dominant. 4. By identifying the role of niche and fitness differences in leading invasion hypotheses, we unify their predictions for invasion success while highlighting new approaches for evaluating the importance of species differences for invasion. 5. Synthesis. Situating the invasion process within a recent coexistence framework broadens our understanding of invasion mechanisms and more tightly links problems in invasion ecology with our more general understanding of community dynamics.},

We used an experimental mycorrhizal plant system to test whether functional similarity among closely related species (phylogenetic conservatism) can drive community assembly and ecosystem functioning. Communities were constructed with the same number of fungal species, but after 1 year of growth, realized species richness was highest where the starting species were more distantly related to each other. Communities with high realized species richness also stimulated plant productivity more than those with low realized species richness. Our findings suggest that phylogenetic trait conservatism can promote coexistence because of reduced competition between distinct evolutionary lineages and enhance ecosystem function because of functional complementarity among those same lineages.},

abstract = {Metabolic theory specifies constraints on the metabolic organisation of individual organisms. These constraints have important implications for biological processes ranging from the scale of molecules all the way to the level of populations, communities and ecosystems, with their application to the latter emerging as the field of metabolic ecology. While ecologists continue to use individual metabolism to identify constraints in ecological processes, the topic of metabolic scaling remains controversial. Much of the current interest and controversy in metabolic theory relates to recent ideas about the role of supply networks in constraining energy supply to cells. We show that an alternative explanation for physicochemical constraints on individual metabolism, as formalised by dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory, can contribute to the theoretical underpinning of metabolic ecology, while increasing coherence between intra- and interspecific scaling relationships. In particular, we emphasise how the DEB theory considers constraints on the storage and use of assimilated nutrients and derive an equation for the scaling of metabolic rate for adult heterotrophs without relying on optimisation arguments or implying cellular nutrient supply limitation. Using realistic data on growth and reproduction from the literature, we parameterise the curve for respiration and compare the a priori prediction against a mammalian data set for respiration. Because the DEB theory mechanism for metabolic scaling is based on the universal process of acquiring and using pools of stored metabolites (a basal feature of life), it applies to all organisms irrespective of the nature of metabolic transport to cells. Although the DEB mechanism does not necessarily contradict insight from transport-based models, the mechanism offers an explanation for differences between the intra- and interspecific scaling of biological rates with mass, suggesting novel tests of the respective hypotheses.},

abstract = {1. River corridors can be visualised as a three-dimensional mosaic of surface–subsurface exchange patches over multiple spatial scales. Along major flow paths, surface water downwells into the sediment, travels for some distance beneath or along the stream, eventually mixes with ground water, and then returns to the stream. 2. Spatial variations in bed topography and sediment permeability result in a mosaic of patch types (e.g. gravel versus sandy patches) that differ in their hydrological exchange rate with the surface stream. Biogeochemical processes and invertebrate assemblages vary among patch types as a function of the flux of advected channel water that determines the supply of organic matter and terminal electron acceptors. 3. The overall effect of surface–subsurface hydrological exchanges on nutrient cycling and biodiversity in streams not only depends on the proportion of the different patch types, but also on the frequency distribution of patch size and shape. 4. Because nutrients are essentially produced or depleted at the downwelling end of hyporheic flow paths, reach-scale processing rates of nutrients should be greater in stretches with many small patches (e.g. short compact gravel bars) than in stretches with only a few large patches (e.g. large gravel bars). 5. Based on data from the Rho ˆne River, we predict that a reach with many small bars should offer more hyporheic refugia for epigean fauna than a reach containing only a few large gravel bars because benthic organisms accumulate preferentially in sediments located at the upstream and downwelling edge of bars during floods. However, large bars are more stable and may provide the only refugia during severe flood events. 6. In river floodplain systems exhibiting pronounced expansion/contraction cycles, hyporheic assemblages within newly created patches not only depend on the intrinsic characteristics of these patches but also on their life span, hydrological connection with neighbouring patches, and movement patterns of organisms. 7. Empirical and theoretical evidence illustrate how the spatial arrangement of surface– subsurface exchange patches affects heterogeneity in stream nutrient concentration, surface water temperature, and colonisation of dry reaches by invertebrates. 8. Interactions between fluvial action and geomorphic features, resulting from seasonal and episodic flow pulses, alter surface–subsurface exchange pathways and repeatedly modify the configuration of the mosaic, thereby altering the contribution of the hyporheic zone to nutrient transformation and biodiversity in river corridors.},

We staged a manipulative experiment to assess the effectiveness of self-made shelters by web spiders as protection from natural enemies. Scincid lizards were included or excluded from 21 replicated 200-m(2) plots, and spiders therein were classified as exposed or sheltered, depending on whether they were uncovered in their web or hidden in cocoons, leaves/debris, or burrows. We found that exposed spiders were greatly affected by the presence of predatory scincid lizards, whereas sheltered spiders were not. More specifically, lizards, which forage close to the ground, reduced the abundance of exposed spiders by two-thirds but had no effect on the abundance of sheltered spiders. Sheltered spiders were able to avoid predation and share space with lizards, suggesting that shelter construction is a mechanism for reducing predation risk and has important population consequences.},

Our theoretical predictions suggest that the exponent of the power law is directly related to a suitable fractal dimension of the boundaries, to the elongation of the basin, and to the scaling exponent of mainstream lengths. Observational evidence from digital elevation maps of natural basins and numerical simulations for optimal channel networks are found to be in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.

INTR.ODUCTION Power laws, which are the signature of fractal behav-ior [1], have been experimentally observed over a huge range of scales in probability distributions describing river basin morphology [2 — 6]. As a part of the river basin, Quvial networks display a rich variety of fractal and multi{\&}actal structures [1,7] whose dynamic origin and geometrical description are of greatest importance both {\&}om the practical point of view and for a deeper understanding of how natural events occur. The starting point for this work is the seminal work of Hack [8]. He demonstrated the applicability and the far-reaching implications of a power function by relating the area of a drainage basin with the length of the principal river of the basin, for rivers of the Shenandoah Valley and adjacent mountains in Virginia. This empirical relation is widely accepted nowadays although its spatial range of validity [9 — ll] and the inference of the complex role},

abstract = {• Biologically essential elements--especially nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)--constrain plant growth and microbial functioning; however, human activities are drastically altering the magnitude and pattern of such nutrient limitations on land. Here we examine interactions between N and P cycles of P mineralizing enzyme activities (phosphatase enzymes) across a wide variety of terrestrial biomes. • We synthesized results from 34 separate studies and used meta-analysis to evaluate phosphatase activity with N, P, or N×P fertilization. • Our results show that N fertilization enhances phosphatase activity, from the tropics to the extra-tropics, both on plant roots and in bulk soils. By contrast, P fertilization strongly suppresses rates of phosphatase activity. • These results imply that phosphatase enzymes are strongly responsive to changes in local nutrient cycle conditions. We also show that plant phosphatases respond more strongly to fertilization than soil phosphatases. The tight coupling between N and P provides a mechanism for recent observations of N and P co-limitation on land.

abstract = {The addition of spatial structure to ecological concepts and theories has spurred integration between sub-disciplines within ecology, including community and ecosystem ecology. However, the complexity of spatial models limits their implementation to idealized, regular landscapes. We present a model meta-ecosystem with finite and irregular spatial structure consisting of local nutrient-autotrophs-herbivores ecosystems connected through spatial flows of materials and organisms. We study the effect of spatial flows on stability and ecosystem functions, and provide simple metrics of connectivity that can predict these effects. Our results show that high rates of nutrient and herbivore movement can destabilize local ecosystem dynamics, leading to spatially heterogeneous equilibria or oscillations across the meta-ecosystem, with generally increased meta-ecosystem primary and secondary production. However, the onset and the spatial scale of these emergent dynamics depend heavily on the spatial structure of the meta-ecosystem and on the relative movement rate of the autotrophs. We show how this strong dependence on finite spatial structure eludes commonly used metrics of connectivity, but can be predicted by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix that describe the spatial structure and scale. Our study indicates the need to consider finite-size ecosystems in meta-ecosystem theory.},

To achieve these goals, it is essential to foster the development of what we call efficient theories, which have several key attributes. Efficient theories are grounded in first principles, are usually expressed in the language of mathematics, make few assumptions and generate a large number of predictions per free parameter, are approximate, and entail predictions that provide well-understood standards for comparison with empirical data. We contend that the development and successive refinement of efficient theories provide a solid foundation for advancing environmental science in the era of big data.},

We restrict our examples to the species found in human houses - a subset of the environments constituting the indoor biome - and offer preliminary hypotheses to advance the study of indoor evolution. Studies of the indoor biome are situated at the intersection of evolutionary ecology, anthropology, architecture, and human ecology and are well suited for citizen science projects, public outreach, and large-scale international collaborations.},

abstract = {Transitions between regimes with radically different properties are ubiquitous in nature. Such transitions can occur either smoothly or in an abrupt and catastrophic fashion. Important examples of the latter can be found in ecology, climate sciences, and economics, to name a few, where regime shifts have catastrophic consequences that are mostly irreversible (e.g., desertification, coral reef collapses, and market crashes). Predicting and preventing these abrupt transitions remains a challenging and important task. Usually, simple deterministic equations are used to model and rationalize these complex situations. However, stochastic effects might have a profound effect. Here we use 1D and 2D spatially explicit models to show that intrinsic (demographic) stochasticity can alter deterministic predictions dramatically, especially in the presence of other realistic features such as limited mobility or spatial heterogeneity. In particular, these ingredients can alter the possibility of catastrophic shifts by giving rise to much smoother and easily reversible continuous ones. The ideas presented here can help further understand catastrophic shifts and contribute to the discussion about the possibility of preventing such shifts to minimize their disruptive ecological, economic, and societal consequences.},

Here we tested whether the mechanisms that underlie bacterial à-diversity vary over centimeters to continental spatial scales by comparing the composition of ammonia-oxidizing bacte- ria communities in salt marsh sediments. As observed in studies of macroorganisms, the drivers of salt marsh bacterial à-diversity depend on spatial scale. In contrast to macroorganism studies, however, we found no evidence of evolutionary diversi␣cation of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria taxa at the continental scale, de- spite an overall relationship between geographic distance and community similarity. Our data are consistent with the idea that dispersal limitation at local scales can contribute to à-diversity, even though the 16S rRNA genes of the relatively common taxa are globally distributed. These results highlight the importance of considering multiple spatial scales for understanding microbial biogeography.},

The original procedure was modified in order to obtain reliable production estimates in this habitat. This included the use of higher leucine concentrations (50 $\mu$mol l-1) for obtaining substrate saturation, and an enhanced protein extraction procedure after sample fixation. The leucine method was combined with a perfused core technique. Water containing 14C-labelled leucine was perfused up through sediment cores, enabling the measurement of bacterial production in an experimental situation resembling natural conditions in the stream bed. Bacterial production in the Breitenbach, a small upland stream in Central Germany, showed a high degree of spatial variability in the sandy stream bed. It was related closely to sediment organic matter content, whereas varying perfusion rates had less influence. Annual bacterial production was estimated at about 200 g C m-2, demonstrating the potential for bacteria to act as a food resource for benthic fauna in this stream.},

Mediterranean streams are known to experience droughts, but Central European headwaters are also beginning to be affected. The development of bacterial communities (abundance, composition) and the recovery of microbial functions (bacterial production, extracellular enzyme activity) were explored after rewetting desiccated streambed sediments via a sediment core perfusion technique. The bacterial community composition changed only slightly in the sediments from the Central European stream Breitenbach (Germany), but distinctly in the Mediterranean Mulargia River (Sardinia, Italy) during 4 days of experimental rewetting. Breitenbach sediments probably enabled survival of bacterial communities more similar to indigenous streambed communities, because they were less dry. High activity of enzymes involved in polymer degradation at the beginning of rewetting in both sediments indicated the persistence of extracellular enzymes during drought. After 4 days, nearly all microbial activities reached a level similar to unaffected sediments for the Breitenbach, but not for Mulargia. Here, much more intense drying resulted in a more distinct change and reduction of the microbial community, responsible for slower recovery of structure and functions.},

We experimentally investigated how initial local diversity and dispersal frequency affect local diversity and biomass production in open benthic microalgal metacommunities. Final local species richness and local biomass production were strongly influenced by dispersal frequency but not by initial local diversity. Both final local richness and final local biomass showed a hump-shaped pattern with increasing dispersal frequency, with a maximum at intermediate dispersal frequencies. Consequently, final local biomass increased linearly with increasing final richness. We conclude that the general relationship between richness and ecosystem functioning remains valid in open systems, but the maintenance of ecosystem processes significantly depends on the effects of dispersal on species richness and local interactions.},

The list is organized hierarchically, beginning with questions at the level of individual populations, and progressing through interacting populations to entire communities or ecosystems. I will try to guess both at possible advances in basic knowledge and at potential applications.

abstract = {Mathematical models for communities of interacting species usually seek to relate the population growth rates to the various inter- and intraspecific interactions. If birth is a continuous process, so that the populations grow in a continuous manner, one ends up with a system of differential equations; conversely, if generations are discrete, so that population growth is a discrete process, the result is a system of difference equations. Corresponding to any particular differential equation system is an analogous difference equation system, which embodies identical biological assumptions except that time is a discrete rather than a continuous variable. I make explicit the relation between the stability properties of any such pair of models, showing in precisely what sense the populations in the difference equation system tend to be less stable than those in the differential equation model. Although this point is basically a commonplace one, some of its implications do not seem to be widely appreciated. By way of illustration, detailed comments are made about aspects of some particular models (e.g., Lotka-Volterra; Nicholson-Bailey).},

abstract = {First, we consider a simple mathematical model for a many-predator-many-prey system, and show it to be in general less stable, and never more stable, than the analogous one-predator-one-prey community. This result would seem to caution against any simple belief that increasing population stability is a mathematical consequence of increasing multispecies complexity. Second, we take up the question of the relation between stability in any one trophic level by itself and stability of the total trophic web. We find that in a simple mathematical model the criteria for isolated single-level stability and for total web stability are not identical, but they tend to be similar, so that usually stability (or instability) at one level goes with stability (or instability) of the whole. It is possible, however, to construct examples where either stability at one level occurs in an overall unstable system, or alternatively instability at one level goes with total web stability. This model points the way to a synthesis of the diverse views that have been expressed on this subject.},

abstract = {The relation between the dynamics of population models in which all the environmental parameters are strictly deterministic and the corresponding more realistic models with random environmental fluctuations are considered. The connection between the deterministic, mechanical usage of the term "stability" and that usage which associates stability or instability with the degree of random population fluctuation in a stochastic environment is discussed. The eigenvalues of the (deterministic or average) "interaction matrix" or "community matrix" play a key role in both circumstances. In the deterministic environment, only the signs of the real parts of these eigenvalues are needed to know whether the population interactions are stabilizing. In the stochastic environment, where the system may be in tension between the stabilizing population interactions and the destabilizing environmental fluctuations, the magnitudes of the real parts of these eigenvalues must be contrasted with the magnitudes of the characteristic environmental variances. These points are developed in a general way and are illustrated by specific analytic and numerical work on single-species and multispecies models. Some applications of the theory are indicated, both to circumstances where it may be used to justify deterministic calculations and to the opposite extreme circumstances where even the smallest environmental stochasticity leads to a result qualitatively different from the deterministic one.},

abstract = {The relationship between environmental variability and niche overlap is studied for a class of model biological communities in which several species compete on a one-dimensional continuum of resources, e.g., food size. In a strictly unvarying (deterministic) environment, there is in general no limit to the degree of overlap, short of complete congruence. However, in a fluctuating (stochastic) environment, the average food sizes for species adjacent on the resource spectrum must differ by an amount roughly equal to the standard deviation in the food size taken by either individual species. This mathematical result emerges in a nonobvious yet robust way for environmental fluctuations whose variance relative to their mean ranges from around 0.01{\%} to around 30{\%}. In short, there is an effective limit to niche overlap in the real world, and this limit is insensitive to the degree of environmental fluctuation, unless it be very severe. Recent field work, particularly on bird guilds, seems in harmony with the model's conclusion.},

The model is intended to represent a warm-blooded vertebrate predator and its prey. The main conclusions are: (1) Coexistence of predator and prey is possible, but if so, the number of prey present will not be substantially below the equilibrium number in the absence of predators. Mutual regulation of predator and prey, with the latter substantially below the carrying capacity of the environment, is unstable. (2) Coexistence is more likely if there are differences in hunting ability between different individual predators--for example, between young and old predators. (3) Cover for the prey enables the prey species to survive the extinction of the predator, but does not make coexistence more likely.},

abstract = {Nonparametric multivariate analysis of ecological data using permutation tests has two main challenges: (1) to partition the variability in the data according to a complex design or model, as is often required in ecological experiments, and (2) to base the analysis on a multivariate distance measure (such as the semimetric Bray-Curtis measure) that is reasonable for ecological data sets. Previous nonparametric methods have succeeded in one or other of these areas, but not in both. A recent contribution to Ecological Monographs by Legendre and Anderson, called distance-based redundancy analysis (db- RDA), does achieve both. It does this by calculating principal coordinates and subsequently correcting for negative eigenvalues, if they are present, by adding a constant to squared distances. We show here that such a correction is not necessary. Partitioning can be achieved directly from the distance matrix itself, with no corrections and no eigenanalysis, even if the distance measure used is semimetric. An ecological example is given to show the differences in these statistical methods. Empirical simulations, based on parameters estimated from real ecological species abundance data, showed that db-RDA done on multifactorial designs (using the correction) does not have type 1 error consistent with the significance level chosen for the analysis (i.e., does not provide an exact test), whereas the direct method described and advocated here does.},

A reduction of the two-dimensional nullsurfaces to a set of one-dimensional curves allows for an intuitive understanding of the equilibria structure. With the reduction in hand, we then perform a local bifurcation analysis around an organizing center and categorize the entire parameter space into twelve different regions of dynamic behaviour. These regions in parameter space are characterized by an extremely rich set of dynamical behaviours, including multiple domains of attraction, quasi-periodicity, chaos, homoclinic events, and transient chaos.

abstract = {Large predators are often highly mobile and can traverse and use multiple habitats. We know surprisingly little about how predator mobility determines important processes of ecosystem connectivity. Here we used a variety of data sources drawn from Palmyra Atoll, a remote tropical marine ecosystem where large predators remain in high abundance, to investigate how these animals foster connectivity. Our results indicate that three of Palmyra's most abundant large predators (e.g., two reef sharks and one snapper) use resources from different habitats creating important linkages across ecosystems. Observations of cross-system foraging such as this have important implications for the understanding of ecosystem functioning, the management of large-predator populations, and the design of conservation measures intended to protect whole ecosystems. In the face of widespread declines of large, mobile predators, it is important that resource managers, policy makers, and ecologists work to understand how these predators create connectivity and to determine the impact that their depletions may be having on the integrity of these linkages.},

abstract = {Ecological theory predicts that stable populations should yield to large-amplitude cycles in richer environments1, 2, 3. This does not occur in nature. The zooplankton Daphnia and its algal prey in lakes throughout the world illustrate the problem4, 5, 6. Experiments show that this system fits the theory's assumptions7, 8, 9, yet it is not destabilized by enrichment6. We have tested and rejected four of five proposed explanations10. Here, we investigate the fifth mechanism: inedible algae in nutrient-rich lakes suppress cycles by reducing nutrients available to edible algae. We found three novel results in nutrient-rich microcosms from which inedible algae were excluded. First, as predicted by theory, some Daphnia-edible algal systems now display large-amplitude predator-prey cycles. Second, in the same environment, other populations are stable, showing only small-amplitude demographic cycles. Stability is induced when Daphnia diverts energy from the immediate production of young. Third, the system exhibits coexisting attractors—a stable equilibrium and large-amplitude cycle. We describe a mechanism that flips the system between these two states.},

abstract = {Rates and reactions of biogeochemical processes vary in space and time to produce both hot spots and hot moments of elemental cycling. We define biogeochemical hot spots as patches that show disproportionately high reaction rates relative to the surrounding matrix, whereas hot moments are defined as short periods of time that exhibit disproportionately high reaction rates relative to longer intervening time periods. As has been appreciated by ecologists for decades, hot spot and hot moment activity is often enhanced at terrestrial-aquatic interfaces. Using examples from the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, we show that hot spots occur where hydrological flowpaths converge with substrates or other flowpaths containing complementary or missing reactants. Hot moments occur when episodic hydrological flowpaths reactivate and/or mobilize accumulated reactants. By focusing on the delivery of specific missing reactants via hydrologic flowpaths, we can forge a better mechanistic understanding of the factors that create hot spots and hot moments. Such a mechanistic understanding is necessary so that biogeochemical hot spots can be identified at broader spatiotemporal scales and factored into quantitative models. We specifically recommend that resource managers incorporate both natural and artificially created biogeochemical hot spots into their plans for water quality management. Finally, we emphasize the needs for further research to assess the potential importance of hot spot and hot moment phenomena in the cycling of different bioactive elements, improve our ability to predict their occurrence, assess their importance in landscape biogeochemistry, and evaluate their utility as tools for resource management.},

abstract = {We studied epiphytic macrolichen communities and occurrences of rare species along the transition from upland to riparian forests on a range of stream sizes (intermittent, non-fish-bearing perennial, fish-bearing but less than 5(th) order, and streams larger than 5(th) order), based on 92, 0.38 ha plots in the McKenzie River watershed of the central Cascades of Oregon. The transition from uplands higher in the watershed to riparian areas along large streams is expressed in decreasing elevation and increasing representation of hardwoods. Upland stands were almost 100{\%} conifers, averaging 49 m(2)/ha in stand basal area, decreasing to 48{\%} conifers along fish-bearing streams of fourth order and below, and finally to 30{\%} along large streams. Stand basal areas of hardwoods averaged near zero in uplands, increasing to an average of 11 m(2)/ha along large streams. One NMS ordination axis described this gradient in macrolichen communities, expressing 72{\%} of the variation in community composition. Epiphytic lichens along large streams differed from fish-bearing streams smaller than fifth order; both of these stream classes also differed strongly from each of the other stream classes. Epiphytic lichens in uplands, along intermittent streams, and non-fish-bearing streams overlapped broadly in species composition. Macrolichen species richness was highest along large streams, averaging 38 species per plot, versus about 28 species per plot for uplands and non-fish-bearing streams. This difference is attributable to more species of cyanolichens, matrix lichens, and nitrophilous lichens along the large streams. About half of the individual species differed in abundance among stream classes, based on Indicator Species Analysis. Listed species (considered at risk by a government agency) were 57{\%} more frequent in riparian areas along large streams than in uplands or along small streams. Protecting riparian zones from logging and urbanization and other forms of habitat destruction will, therefore, protect many rare species. Uplands and small streams, however, supported distinctive macrolichen communities, including rare species that were infrequent or absent from the riparian zones of large streams.},

There is growing interest in the adaptation of nonhuman organisms to urban environments, and we distinguish between the concepts of adaptation and adaptedness. Most of these studies have focused on animals, especially birds. Commonly recorded responses to urban environments include regulatory and acclimatory responses involving changes in behavior, communication, and physiology. Developmental responses tend to be morphological in nature but can also involve cultural learning. There is growing evidence of microevolutionary changes associated with adaptive responses to urban environments. This review also highlights the urgent need to refine the terminology currently used to describe the adaptation of organisms to urban environments in order to improve scientific understanding and more effectively identify and communicate the actions required to create biodiversity- and adaptatio...},

abstract = {In order to understand the effect of urban development on the functioning of forest ecosystems, during the past decade we have been studying red oak stands located on similar soil along an urban-rural gradient running from New York City ro rural Litchfield County, Connecticut. This paper summarizes the results of this work. Field measurements, controlled laboratory experiments, and reciprocal transplants documented soil pollution, soil hydrophobicity, litter decomposition rates, total soil carbon, potential nitrogen mineralization, nitrification, fungal biomass, and earthworm populations in forests along the 140 × 20 km study transect. The results revealed a complex urban-rural environmental gradient. The urban forests exhibit unique ecosystem structure and function in relation to the suburban and rural forest stands; these are likely linked to stresses of the urban environment such as air pollution, which has also resulted in elevated levels of heavy metals in the soil, the positive effects of the heat island phenomenon, and the presence of earthworms. The data suggest a working model to guide mechanistic work on the ecology of forests along urban-to-rural gradients, and for comparison of different metropolitan areas.},

abstract = {In most environments, bacteria reside primarily in biofilms, which are social consortia of cells that are embedded in an extracellular matrix and undergo developmental programmes resulting in a predictable biofilm 'life cycle'. Recent research on many different bacterial species has now shown that the final stage in this life cycle includes the production and release of differentiated dispersal cells. The formation of these cells and their eventual dispersal is initiated through diverse and remarkably sophisticated mechanisms, suggesting that there are strong evolutionary pressures for dispersal from an otherwise largely sessile biofilm. The evolutionary aspect of biofilm dispersal is now being explored through the integration of molecular microbiology with eukaryotic ecological and evolutionary theory, which provides a broad conceptual framework for the diversity of specific mechanisms underlying biofilm dispersal. Here, we review recent progress in this emerging field and suggest that the merging of detailed molecular mechanisms with ecological theory will significantly advance our understanding of biofilm biology and ecology.},

We suggest this approach can create a more quantitative and predictive science that can more readily address issues of global change.},

Unified theories have been important in physics including the unification of electricity and magnetism and the unification of the electromagnetic with the weak nuclear force. Surprisingly, ecology, specifically the subfields of biodiversity and macroecology, also possess not one but at least six unified theories. This is problematic as only one unified theory is desirable. Superficially, the six unified theories seem very different. However, I show that all six theories use the same three rules or assertions to describe a stochastic geometry of biodiversity. The three rules are: (1) intraspecifically individuals are clumped together; (2) interspecifically global or regional abundance varies according to a hollow curve distribution; and (3) interspecifically individuals are placed without regard to individuals of other species. These three rules appear sufficient to explain local species abundance distributions, species-area relationships, decay of similarity of distance and possibly other patterns of biodiversity. This provides a unification of the unified theories. I explore implications of this unified theory for future research.},

abstract = {We describe a general framework for testing neutral theory. We summarize similarities and differences between ten different versions of neutral theory. Two central predictions of neutral theory are that species abundance distributions will follow a zero-sum multinomial distribution and that community composition will change over space due to dispersal limitation. We review all published empirical tests of neutral theory. With the exception of one type of test, all tests fail to support neutral theory. We identify and perform several new tests. Specifically, we develop a set of best practices for testing the fit of the zero-sum multinomial (ZSM) vs. a lognormal null hypothesis and apply this to a data set, concluding that the lognormal outperforms neutral theory on robust tests. We explore whether a priori parameterization of neutral theory is possible, and we conclude that it is not. We show that non-curve-fitting predictions readily derived from neutral theory are easily falsifiable. In toto, there is a current overwhelming weight of evidence against neutral theory. We suggest some next steps for neutral theory.},

abstract = {By coupling synoptic data from a basin-wide assessment of stream-water chemistry with network-based geostatistical analysis, we show that spatial processes differentially affect biogeochemical condition and pattern across a headwater stream network. We analyzed a high-resolution dataset consisting of 664 water samples collected every 100 m throughout 32 tributaries in an entire fifth-order stream network. These samples were analyzed for an exhaustive suite of chemical constituents. The fine grain and broad extent of this study design allowed us to quantify spatial patterns over a range of scales by using empirical semivario-grams that explicitly incorporated network topology. Here, we show that spatial structure, as determined by the characteristic shape of the semivariograms, differed both among chemical constituents and by spatial relationship (flow-connected, flow-unconnected, or Euclidean). Spatial structure was apparent at either a single scale or at multiple nested scales, suggesting separate processes operating simultaneously within the stream network and surrounding terrestrial landscape. Expected pat-terns of spatial dependence for flow-connected relationships (e.g., increasing homogeneity with downstream distance) occurred for some chemical constituents (e.g., dissolved organic carbon, sulfate, and aluminum) but not for others (e.g., nitrate, sodium). By comparing semivariograms for the different chemical constitu-ents and spatial relationships, we were able to separate effects on streamwater chemistry of (i) fine-scale versus broad-scale processes and (ii) in-stream processes versus landscape con-trols. These findings provide insight on the hierarchical scaling of local, longitudinal, and landscape processes that drive bio-geochemical patterns in stream networks. biogeochemistry | hydrologic connectivity | watershed | autocorrelation |},

abstract = {By over-focusing on precise definitions, ecology has produced a confused idea of the niche concept. This, our second paper, develops a practical philosophy for the niche that approaches the concept at the correct level of abstraction. We deconstruct the niche into effect and response components and then reconstruct those parts into a general, visual schematic of the niche and ecology. Using this schematic we examine the relationship of particular niche ideas to ecology, and examine the relationship between niche and ecological sub-disciplines, particularly species distribution modelling (SDM). This general description clarifies the duality of the niche concept, as both a facet of species and a facet of environments. Unclear use of these dual concepts can confuse the scientific approach, and our ideas about uncertainty and error. By misclassifying models as concepts, ecology has confused the niche. Our practical philosophy uses the current wealth of ecological and niche ideas as a panoramic view of a general niche concept. We argue that stitching the niche produces a concept that underpins straightforward ecological thinking.},

abstract = {In a discussion it is often easier to staunchly reject or offer resolute support for an idea. This third paper on the niche concept aims to develop a balanced argument by exploring general principles for determining an appropriate level for pitching the niche concept that will guide better use and less abuse of niche concepts. To do this we first have to accept that niche concepts are not necessarily essential for ecology. Rather than to improve niche concepts, our aim should then be to pitch the niche in terms of ecology. This aim helps us develop an ‘ultimate goal of the niche' by which we can evaluate the concepts we use. For species distribution modelling, there has been a focus on the niche as an equilibrium outcome that perhaps has less relevance for disequilibrium situations (e.g. climate change projections). As is the case for much of ecology, more causal explanations of species' distributions use alternative terminologies and less frequently use the word ‘niche'. We suggest that niche concepts that are better aligned with the rest of ecology could arise from taking more responsibility for our own implementations, and by explaining our models with terms other than niche. A general, holistic niche concept promotes this view and promotes practical thinking about what we are modelling and how we interpret those models, which in turn should help inspire and support innovative modelling approaches in species distribution modelling.},

abstract = {In this first of three papers we examine the use of niche concepts in ecology and especially in species distribution modelling (SDM). This paper deliberately focuses on the lack of clarity found in the term ‘niche'. Because its meanings are so diverse, the term niche tends to create confusion and requires constant qualification. The literature houses many idiosyncratic ideas of what the niche is, but few examples where niche is more explanatory than the terminologies of population and community ecology or the statistical methods used to implement SDM analyses. In many cases the original (and inspirational) concepts are not directly applicable to our modern applications (e.g. set theory). There are some conceptual limitations found in individual definitions of niche (e.g. the fundamental niche concept), so it is perhaps understandable why more neutral terminology is becoming popular in SDM. An examination of the literature reveals a wide range of uncritical use of niche terminology. Our findings in this paper do not necessarily support the position of niche as a universally useful concept.},

abstract = {We studied the fluorescence properties of fulvic acids isolated from streams and rivers receiving predominantly terrestrial sources of organic material and from lakes with microbial sources of organic material. Microbially derived fulvic acids have fluorophores with a more sharply defined emission peak occurring at lower wavelengths than fluorophores in terrestrially derived fulvic acids. We show that the ratio of the emission intensity at a wavelength of 450 nm to that at 500 nm, obtained with an excitation of 370 nm, can serve as a simple index to distinguish sources of isolated aquatic fulvic acids. In our study, this index has a value of ∼1.9 for microbially derived fulvic acids and a value of∼1.4 for terrestrially derived fulvic acids. Fulvic acids isolated from four large rivers in the United States have fluorescence index values of 1.4-1.5, consistent with predominantly terrestrial sources. For fulvic acid samples isolated from a river, lakes, and groundwaters in a forested watershed, the fluorescence index varied in a manner suggesting different sources for the seepage and streamfed lakes. Furthermore, we identified these distinctive fluorophores in filtered whole water samples from lakes in a desert oasis in Antarctica and in filtered whole water samples collected during snowmelt from a Rocky Mountain stream. The fluorescence index measurement in filtered whole water samples in field studies may augment the interpretation of dissolved organic carbon sources for understanding carbon cycling in aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {Introducing a spatially heterogeneous environment to the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey diffusion model reveals that spatial pattern is amplified and the dynamics are stabilized by non-linear environmental heterogeneity and differential species mobility. When predators diffuse and prey are sedentary, heterogeneity in the prey growth rate is amplified in the prey equilibrium distribution. When both species diffuse rapidly, pattern in the distributions are homogenized, but their total abundances are maximized. In contrast to the non-spatial constant Lotka-Volterra model, which features sustained oscillations, perturbations to the heterogeneous environment model decays to equilibrium exponentially fast. When prey are stationary, the rate of decay is proportional to the predator diffusion coefficient. The rate of approach to equilibrium slows as prey mobility increases. These results are interpreted as the creation of a prey refuge by density-dependence implicit in the notion of non-uniformly distributed diffusing populations.},

When predators move on a large scale relative to prey, local coupling of the predator-prey interaction is replaced by global coupling. Prey with low dispersal ability become narrowly confined to the most productive habitats, strongly amplifying the underlying spatial pattern of the environment. As prey diffusion rate increases, the prey distribution spreads out and predator abundance declines. The model retains neutrally stable Lotka-Volterra temporal dynamics: different scales of predator and prey dispersal do not stabilize the interaction. The model predicts that, for prey populations that are limited by widely ranging predators, species with low dispersal ability should be restricted to discrete high density patches, and those with greater mobility should be more uniformly distributed at lower density.},

These characteristics are likely (i) central to ecosystem function and stability based on theory, and (ii) widespread across ecosystem types based on empirical observations. The temporal food web perspective outlined here could provide new insight into the ecosystem-level consequences of altered abiotic and biotic processes that might accompany globally changing environments.},

A review of the empirical evidence suggests that refuges are indeed capable of playing the former role. But the conditions under which they do so are not understood, nor is there any solid evidence for an effect on population fluctuations. The intuitive view that refuges act to stabilize equilibria and damp predator-prey oscillations is based in several theoretical studies of extremely simple models. Using a more realistic model, I show that several kinds of refuges can exert a locally destabilizing effect and create stable, large-amplitude oscillations which would damp out if no refuge was present. This finding contrasts sharply with the usual view. I argue that current evidence is tol weak, and the range of theoretically possible effects is too broad, to justify any simple characterization of refuge effects in nature. Manipulative empirical studies are an important first step toward correcting this situation, and I discuss some important factors to consider in their design.},

abstract = {Using a simple two-patch model, we examine how patterns of spatial and temporal variation in carrying capacities affect natural selection on dispersal. The size of the population in each patch is regulated separately, according to a discrete-generation logistic equation, and individuals disperse from each patch at propensities determined by their genotype. We consider genotypes that express the same dispersal propensities in both patches and genotypes that express patch-specific disperal propensities. Contrary to previous analyses, our results show that some level of dispersal is favored by selection under almost all regimes of habitat variability, including a spatially varying and temporally constant environment. Furthermore, two very different polymorphisms are favored under different conditions. When carrying capacities vary spatially but not temporally, any number of genotypes with patch-specific dispersal propensities in ratios inversely proportional to the ratio of the carrying capacities can coexist. This result extends previous analyses to show that dispersal is favored in such an environment if individuals can alter dispersal propensities in response to environmental cues. In contrast, when carrying capacities vary both spatially and temporally but differ in mean or variance, a polymorphism of only two genotypes (a high-dispersal and a no-dispersal genotype) is favored when the only genotypes possible are ones expressing the same dispersal propensity in both patches. However, this dimorphism can be invaded and replaced by one genotype with a particular combination of patch-specific dispersal propensities in a ratio also inversely proportional to the ratio of the average population sizes. We discuss a number of testable predictions this model suggests about the amounts of phenotypic and genetic variation in dispersal characters that are expected both within and between populations, and the degree to which the expression of phenotypic characters affecting dispersal propensity should be sensitive to environmental conditions. The model also suggests novel mechanisms for coexistence between competing species in varying environments.},

abstract = {Urban ecology is a field encompassing multiple disciplines and practical applications and has grown rapidly. However, the field is heterogeneous as a global inquiry with multiple theoretical and conceptual frameworks, variable research approaches, and a lack of coordination among multiple schools of thought and research foci. Here, we present an international consensus on how urban ecology can advance along multiple research directions. There is potential for the field to mature as a holistic, integrated science of urban systems. Such an integrated science could better inform decisionmakers who need increased understanding of complex relationships among social, ecological, economic, and built infrastructure systems. To advance the field requires conceptual synthesis, knowledge and data sharing, cross-city comparative research, new intellectual networks, and engagement with additional disciplines. We consider challenges and opportunities for understanding dynamics of urban systems. We suggest pathways for advancing urban ecology research to support the goals of improving urban sustainability and resilience, conserving urban biodiversity, and promoting human well-being on an urbanizing planet. D espite significant challenges, cities are at the forefront of sustainability practice, serving as the focal points of actions promoting sustainability pathways (Rosenzweig et al. 2010). Ecological principles are key to transformative change to achieve resilience to climate change and other urban stressors (Royal Society 2014). How can scholars of urban ecology develop the necessary knowl-edge to promote resilience and help set cities and future urbanization on sustainable trajectories? What changes in the theory and practice of urban ecology can be envisioned to tackle such challenges? In 2013, at the Society for Urban Ecology First World Congress in Berlin, we gathered a diverse, international team of leading urban ecologists to answer these questions. Rather than approaching these questions with a dense review, we developed a consensus to guide future urban ecological research. This hard-won consensus was achieved despite diverse perspectives, cultural traditions, and modes of appli-cation among our team. Our goals in presenting this consen-sus are to motivate new and advanced cross-city comparative ecology, to develop more unified conceptual frameworks to advance urban ecology theory, and to synthesize core urban ecology research principles to guide future research in the field. Urban ecology has emerged as a multidisciplinary field with many of the tools needed for advancing cities' sus-tainability and resilience. Here, we define resilience as the capacity of a system to absorb stress, to continue to develop, and to change without a loss of essential structure, function, identity, and feedback (Folke 2008). We define sustainability as a continuing process of ensuring the balance of economic, environmental, and human well-being both now and in the future. However, the complexity of social–ecological inter-actions both within cities and across interconnected urban regions—where purportedly sustainable choices made in one place are not truly sustainable if they create social, economic, or environmental problems and trade-offs else-where—clearly represent " wicked " problems faced by today's urban ecologists. In this article, we discuss current findings, challenges, and opportunities to advance urban ecology toward a more holistic science of cities. We argue that cen-tral features of future urban ecological research should be synthesis, a complex-systems view, cross-city comparison at multiple scales, and inclusion of more disciplines that take advantage of emerging data sources, methods, and tools. We present a framework to jointly advance these features.},

abstract = {Connectivity among populations and habitats is important for a wide range of ecological processes. Understanding, preserving, and restoring connectivity in complex landscapes requires connectivity models and metrics that are reliable, efficient, and process based. We introduce a new class of ecological connectivity models based in electrical circuit theory. Although they have been applied in other disciplines, circuit-theoretic connectivity models are new to ecology. They offer distinct advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Resistance, current, and voltage calculated across graphs or raster grids can be related to ecological processes ( such as individual movement and gene flow) that occur across large population networks or landscapes. Efficient algorithms can quickly solve networks with millions of nodes, or landscapes with millions of raster cells. Here we review basic circuit theory, discuss relationships between circuit and random walk theories, and describe applications in ecology, evolution, and conservation. We provide examples of how circuit models can be used to predict movement patterns and fates of random walkers in complex landscapes and to identify important habitat patches and movement corridors for conservation planning.},

abstract = {Determining the amount of recombination in the genealogical history of a sample of genes is important to both evolutionary biology and medical population genetics. However, recurrent mutation can produce patterns of genetic diversity similar to those generated by recombination and can bias estimates of the population recombination rate. Hudson 2001 has suggested an approximate-likelihood method based on coalescent theory to estimate the population recombination rate, 4N(e)r, under an infinite-sites model of sequence evolution. Here we extend the method to the estimation of the recombination rate in genomes, such as those of many viruses and bacteria, where the rate of recurrent mutation is high. In addition, we develop a powerful permutation-based method for detecting recombination that is both more powerful than other permutation-based methods and robust to misspecification of the model of sequence evolution. We apply the method to sequence data from viruses, bacteria, and human mitochondrial DNA. The extremely high level of recombination detected in both HIV1 and HIV2 sequences demonstrates that recombination cannot be ignored in the analysis of viral population genetic data.},

abstract = {The nature and scale of recombination rate variation are largely unknown for most species. In humans, pedigree analysis has documented variation at the chromosomal level, and sperm studies have identified specific hotspots in which crossing-over events cluster. To address whether this picture is representative of the genome as a whole, we have developed and validated a method for estimating recombination rates from patterns of genetic variation. From extensive single-nucleotide polymorphism surveys in European and African populations, we find evidence for extreme local rate variation spanning four orders in magnitude, in which 50{\%} of all recombination events take place in less than 10{\%} of the sequence. We demonstrate that recombination hotspots are a ubiquitous feature of the human genome, occurring on average every 200 kilobases or less, but recombination occurs preferentially outside genes.},

Elderly survivors of the kuru epidemic, who had multiple exposures at mortuary feasts, are, in marked contrast to younger unexposed Fore, predominantly PRNP 129 heterozygotes. Kuru imposed strong balancing selection on the Fore, essentially eliminating PRNP 129 homozygotes. Worldwide PRNP haplotype diversity and coding allele frequencies suggest that strong balancing selection at this locus occurred during the evolution of modern humans.},

abstract = {Dispersal of microbes between humans and the built environment can occur through direct contact with surfaces or through airborne release; the latter mechanism remains poorly understood. Humans emit upwards of 10(6) biological particles per hour, and have long been known to transmit pathogens to other individuals and to indoor surfaces. However it has not previously been demonstrated that humans emit a detectible microbial cloud into surrounding indoor air, nor whether such clouds are sufficiently differentiated to allow the identification of individual occupants. We used high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes to characterize the airborne bacterial contribution of a single person sitting in a sanitized custom experimental climate chamber. We compared that to air sampled in an adjacent, identical, unoccupied chamber, as well as to supply and exhaust air sources. Additionally, we assessed microbial communities in settled particles surrounding each occupant, to investigate the potential long-term fate of airborne microbial emissions. Most occupants could be clearly detected by their airborne bacterial emissions, as well as their contribution to settled particles, within 1.5-4 h. Bacterial clouds from the occupants were statistically distinct, allowing the identification of some individual occupants. Our results confirm that an occupied space is microbially distinct from an unoccupied one, and demonstrate for the first time that individuals release their own personalized microbial cloud.},

During an educational workshop, we investigated the utility of mobile phones to gather data about the personal microbiome - the collection of microorganisms associated with the personal effects of an individual. We characterized microbial communities on smartphone touchscreens to determine whether there was significant overlap with the skin microbiome sampled directly from their owners. We found that about 22{\%} of the bacterial taxa on participants' fingers were also present on their own phones, as compared to 17{\%} they shared on average with other people's phones. When considered as a group, bacterial communities on men's phones were significantly different from those on their fingers, while women's were not. Yet when considered on an individual level, men and women both shared significantly more of their bacterial communities with their own phones than with anyone else's. In fact, 82{\%} of the OTUs were shared between a person's index and phone when considering the dominant taxa (OTUs with more than 0.1{\%} of the sequences in an individual's dataset). Our results suggest that mobile phones hold untapped potential as personal microbiome sensors.},

We hypothesized that participation in a sport involving skin to skin contact would result in detectable shifts in skin bacterial community composition. We conducted a study during a flat track roller derby tournament, and found that teammates shared distinct skin microbial communities before and after playing against another team, but that opposing teams' bacterial communities converged during the course of a roller derby bout.

abstract = {Extinction risk in natural populations depends on stochastic factors that affect individuals, and is estimated by incorporating such factors into stochastic models. Stochasticity can be divided into four categories, which include the probabilistic nature of birth and death at the level of individuals (demographic stochasticity), variation in population-level birth and death rates among times or locations (environmental stochasticity), the sex of individuals and variation in vital rates among individuals within a population (demographic heterogeneity). Mechanistic stochastic models that include all of these factors have not previously been developed to examine their combined effects on extinction risk. Here we derive a family of stochastic Ricker models using different combinations of all these stochastic factors, and show that extinction risk depends strongly on the combination of factors that contribute to stochasticity. Furthermore, we show that only with the full stochastic model can the relative importance of environmental and demographic variability, and therefore extinction risk, be correctly determined. Using the full model, we find that demographic sources of stochasticity are the prominent cause of variability in a laboratory population of Tribolium castaneum (red flour beetle), whereas using only the standard simpler models would lead to the erroneous conclusion that environmental variability dominates. Our results demonstrate that current estimates of extinction risk for natural populations could be greatly underestimated because variability has been mistakenly attributed to the environment rather than the demographic factors described here that entail much higher extinction risk for the same variability level.},

Dynamics on larger spatial scales differ from the predictions of local dynamics alone because of an interaction between nonlinearity in population dynamics at the local scale and spatial variation in density and environmental factors over the regional population. Our systematic approach to scaling up involves the following five steps. First, define a model for dynamics on the local spatial scale. Second, apply scale transition theory to identify key interactions between nonlinearity and spatial variation that translate local dynamics to the regional scale. Third, measure local-scale model parameters to determine nonlinearities at local scales. Fourth, measure spatial variation. Finally, combine nonlinearity and variation measures to obtain the scale transition. Using field data for the dynamics of grazers and periphyton in a freshwater stream, we show that scale transition terms greatly reduce the growth and equilibrium density of the periphyton population at the stream scale compared to rock scale populations, confirming the importance of spatial mechanisms to stream-scale dynamics.},

abstract = {How to scale up from local-scale interactions to regional-scale dynamics is a critical issue in field ecology. We show how to implement a systematic approach to the problem of scaling up, using scale transition theory. Scale transition theory shows that dynamics on larger spatial scales differ from predictions based on the local dynamics alone because of an interaction between local-scale nonlinear dynamics and spatial variation in density or the environment. Based on this theory, a systematic approach to scaling up has four steps: (1) derive a model to translate the effects of local dynamics to the regional scale, and to identify key interactions between nonlinearity and spatial variation, (2) measure local-scale model parameters to determine nonlinearities at local scales, (3) measure spatial variation, and (4) combine nonlinearity and variation measures to obtain the scale transition. We illustrate the approach, with an example from benthic stream ecology of caddisflies living in riffles. By sampling from a simulated system, we show how collecting the appropriate data at local (riffle) scales to measure nonlinearities, combined with measures of spatial variation, leads to the correct inference for dynamics at the larger scale of the stream. The approach provides a way to investigate the mechanisms and consequences of changes in population dynamics with spatial scale using a relatively small amount of field data.},

abstract = {Insight into the dependence of benthic communities on biological and physical processes in nearshore pelagic environments, long considered a "black box," has eluded ecologists. In rocky intertidal communities at Oregon coastal sites 80 km apart, differences in abundance of sessile invertebrates, herbivores, carnivores, and macrophytes in the low zone were not readily explained by local scale differences in hydrodynamic or physical conditions (wave forces, surge flow, or air temperature during low tide). Field experiments employing predator and herbivore manipulations and prey transplants suggested top-down (predation, grazing) processes varied positively with bottom-up processes (growth of filter-feeders, prey recruitment), but the basis for these differences was unknown. Shore-based sampling revealed that between-site differences were associated with nearshore oceanographic conditions, including phytoplankton concentration and productivity, particulates, and water temperature during upwelling. Further, samples taken at 19 sites along 380 km of coastline suggested that the differences documented between two sites reflect broader scale gradients of phytoplankton concentration. Among several alternative explanations, a coastal hydrodynamics hypothesis, reflecting mesoscale (tens to hundreds of kilometers) variation in the interaction between offshore currents and winds and continental shelf bathymetry, was inferred to be the primary underlying cause. Satellite imagery and offshore chlorophyll-a samples are consistent with the postulated mechanism. Our results suggest that benthic community dynamics can be coupled to pelagic ecosystems by both trophic and transport linkages.},

abstract = {Increasing human populations have resulted in aggressive water development in arid regions. This development typically results in altered stream flow regimes, reduced annual flow volumes, changes in fluvial disturbance regimes, changes in groundwater levels, and subsequent shifts in ecological patterns and processes. Balancing human demands for water with environmental requirements to maintain functioning ecosystems requires quantitative linkages between water in streams and ecosystem attributes. Streams in the Sonoran Desert provide important habitat for vertebrate species, including resident and migratory birds. Habitat structure, food, and nest-building materials, which are concentrated in riparian areas, are provided directly or indirectly by vegetation. We measured riparian vegetation, groundwater and surface water, habitat structure, and bird occurrence along Cherry Creek, a perennial tributary of the Salt River in central Arizona, USA. The purpose of this work was to develop an integrated model of groundwater-vegetation-habitat structure and bird occurrence by: (1) characterizing structural and provisioning attributes of riparian vegetation through developing a bird habitat index (BHI), (2) validating the utility of our BHI through relating it to measured bird community composition, (3) determining the riparian plant species that best explain the variability in BHI, (4) developing predictive models that link important riparian species to fluvial disturbance and groundwater availability along an arid-land stream, and (5) simulating the effects of changes in flow regime and groundwater levels and determining their consequences for riparian bird communities. Riparian forest and shrubland vegetation cover types were correctly classified in 83{\%} of observations as a function of fluvial disturbance and depth to water table. Groundwater decline and decreased magnitude of fluvial disturbance caused significant shifts in riparian cover types from riparian forest to shrublands. Variability in the BHI was best explained by the cover of deciduous riparian tree species, primarily Populus fremontii, Platanus wrightii, and Salix gooddingii. The distributions of these plant species were well explained by the depth to groundwater and magnitude of fluvial disturbance along the stream. Bird species diversity and richness were significantly higher in sites with higher habitat indices. This quantitative linkage between surface and groundwater, plant species composition, habitat complexity, and bird communities has implications for water management and in determining environmental flows.},

To address this deficiency, we partitioned the variance in two key functional traits (leaf mass area and leaf dry matter content) across six nested ecological scales (site, plot, species, tree, strata and leaf) in lowland tropical rainforests. In both traits, the plot level shows virtually no variance despite high species turnover among plots and the size of within-species variation (leaf + strata + tree) is comparable with that of species level variation. The lack of variance at the plot level brings substantial support to the idea that trait-based environmental filtering plays a central role in plant community assembly. These results and the finding that the amount of within-species variation is comparable with interspecific variation support a shift of focus from species-based to trait-based ecology.},

abstract = {The diversity of life in headwater streams (intermittent, first and second order) contributes to the biodiversity of a river system and its riparian network. Small streams differ widely in physical, chemical, and biotic attributes, thus providing habitats for a range of unique species. Headwater species include permanent residents as well as migrants that travel to headwaters at particular seasons or life stages. Movement by migrants links headwaters with downstream and terrestrial ecosystems, as do exports such as emerging and drifting insects. We review the diversity of taxa dependent on headwaters. Exemplifying this diversity are three unmapped headwaters that support over 290 taxa. Even intermittent streams may support rich and distinctive biological communities, in part because of the predictability of dry periods. The influence of headwaters on downstream systems emerges from their attributes that meet unique habitat requirements of residents and migrants by: offering a refuge from temperature and flow extremes, competitors, predators, and introduced species; serving as a source of colonists; providing spawning sites and rearing areas; being a rich source of food; and creating migration corridors throughout the landscape. Degradation and loss of headwaters and their connectivity to ecosystems downstream threaten the biological integrity of entire river networks.},

We examined how a virus, bacteriophage $\lambda$, evolved to infect its host, Escherichia coli, through a novel pathway. Natural selection promoted the fixation of mutations in the virus's host-recognition protein, J, that improved fitness on the original receptor, LamB, and set the stage for other mutations that allowed infection through a new receptor, OmpF. These viral mutations arose after the host evolved reduced expression of LamB, whereas certain other host mutations prevented the phage from evolving the new function. This study shows the complex interplay between genomic processes and ecological conditions that favor the emergence of evolutionary innovations.},

abstract = {Using rotifer-algal microcosms, we tracked rapid evolution resulting from temporally changing natural selection in ecological predator-prey dynamics. We previously demonstrated that predator-prey oscillations in rotifer-algal laboratory microcosms are qualitatively altered by the presence of genetic variation within the prey. In that study, changes in algal gene frequencies were inferred from their effects on population dynamics but not observed directly. Here, we document rapid prey evolution in this system by directly observing changes in Chlorella vulgaris genotype frequencies as the abundances of these algae and their consumer, Brachionus calyciflorus, change through time. We isolated a group of algal clones that we could distinguish by using microsatellite-DNA markers, and developed an allele-specific quantitative PCR technique (AsQ-PCR) to quantify the frequencies of pairs of clones in mixed culture. We showed that two of these genotypes exhibited a fitness tradeoff in which one was more resistant to predation (more digestion-resistant), and the other had faster population growth under limiting nitrogen concentrations. A fully specified mathematical model for the rotifer-algal population and evolutionary dynamics predicted that these two clones would undergo a single oscillation in clonal frequencies followed by asymptotic fixation of the more resistant clone, rather than the recurrent oscillations previously observed with other algal clones. We used AsQ-PCR to confirm this prediction: the superior competitor dominated initially, but as rotifer densities increased, the more predator-resistant clone predominated.},

Both resource competition and predation have been suggested as mechanisms driving this process, although the former is better studied than the latter. Here we show experimentally how predation by a protist, Tetrahymena thermophila, affects diversification in a model adaptive radiation of the bacterial prey, Pseudomonas fluorescens. We estimate the frequency-dependent fitness functions of competing niche-specialist prey in the presence and absence of predation, and use these to test hypotheses about the extent (measured as the number of new genotypes) and rate of diversification. Competition and predation independently generated diversifying selection that we show is capable of driving prey diversification to similar extents but at different rates, diversification being markedly delayed in the presence of predators. The cause of this delay stems from weaker diversifying selection due to the reduction in prey density caused by predation. Our results suggest that predation may play an under-appreciated role in driving adaptive radiations.},

abstract = {Many infectious diseases spread through populations via the networks formed by physical contacts among individuals. The patterns of these contacts tend to be highly heterogeneous. Traditional "compartmental" modeling in epidemiology, however, assumes that population groups are fully mixed, that is, every individual has an equal chance of spreading the disease to every other. Applications of compartmental models to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) resulted in estimates of the fundamental quantity called the basic reproductive number R 0 - the number of new cases of SARS resulting from a single initial case - above one, implying that, without public health intervention, most outbreaks should spark large-scale epidemics. Here we compare these predictions to the early epidemiology of SARS. We apply the methods of contact network epidemiology to illustrate that for a single value of R 0, any two outbreaks, even in the same setting, may have very different epidemiological outcomes. We offer quantitative insight into the heterogeneity of SARS outbreaks worldwide, and illustrate the utility of this approach for assessing public health strategies. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we applied 16S rRNA gene amplicon and whole-genome shotgun sequencing to examine the microbial diversity in samples from the Kalamas River (Northwest Greece), a mid-size river that runs though agricultural and NATURA-protected areas, but also receives urban sewage from a large city through a manmade ditch. Samples from three different locations between the exit of the ditch and the estuary, during three different months showed that temporal differences of taxonomic and functional diversity were more pronounced than spatial ones, and {\textless}1{\%} of total taxa were shared among all samples, revealing a highly dynamic ecosystem. Comparisons of gene diversity with other aquatic habitats showed that only the high flow winter samples resembled more to freshwater environments while samples during the decreased water flow months were dominated by sewage inputs and soil-related organisms. Notably, microbial human gut signals were detectable over background freshwater and soil/runoff related signals, even at tens of kilometers downstream the city. These findings revealed the significance of allochthonous inputs on the composition and dynamics of river bacterial communities, and highlighted the potential of metagenomics for source tracking purposes.

abstract = {Group selection is defined as that process of genetic change which is caused by the differential extinction or proliferation of groups of organisms. A very large proportion of the literature pertaining to group selection consists of theoretical papers; the genetic problems of group selection have been addressed from many different mathematical viewpoints. The general conclusion has been that, although group selection is possible, it cannot override the effects of individual selection within populations exceptfor a highly restricted set of parameter values. Since it is unlikely that conditions in natural populations wouldfall within the bounds imposed by the models, group selection, by and large, has been considered an insignificant force for evolutionary change. These theoretical conclusions and the assumptions from which they have been derived are re- examined in the light of recent empirical studies of group selection with laboratory populations of the flour beetle, Tribolium (Wade, 1976, 197 7). It is shown that the models have a number of assumptions in common which are inherently unfavorable to the operation of group selection. Alternative assump- tions derivedfrom the empirical results are suggested and discussed in the hope that they will stimulate further theoretical and empirical study of this controversial subject.},

abstract = {Community variability has a dual nature. On the one hand, there is compositional variability, changes in the relative abundance of component species. On the other hand, there is aggregate variability, changes in summary properties such as total abundance, biomass, or production. Although these two aspects of variability have received much individual attention, few studies have explicitly? related the compositional and aggregate variability of natural communities. In this paper, we show how simultaneous consideration of both aspects of community variability might advance our understanding of ecological communities. We use the distinction between compositional and aggregate variability to develop an organizational framework for describing patterns of community variability. At their extremes, compositional and aggregate variability combine in four different ways: (I) stasis, low compositional and low aggregate variability; (2) synchrony, low compositional and high aggregate variability; (3) asynchrony, high compositional and high aggregate variability; and (4) compensation, high compositional and low aggregate variability. Each of these patterns has been observed in natural communities, and can be linked to a suite of abiotic and biotic mechanisms. We give examples of the potential relevance of variability patterns to applied ecology, and describe the methodological developments needed to make meaningful comparisons of aggregate and compositional variability across communities. Finally, we provide two numerical examples of how our approach can be applied to natural communities.},

However, empirical studies of the effects of spatial structure on plant species richness have found inconsistent results, suggesting that more comprehensive approaches are needed. In this study, we asked how landscape structure affects total plant species richness and the richness of a guild of specialized plants in a multivariate context. We sampled herbaceous plant communities at 56 dolomite glades (insular, fire-adapted grasslands) across the Missouri Ozarks, and used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the relative importance of landscape structure, soil resource availability, and fire history for plant communities. We found that landscape spatial structure-defined as the area-weighted proximity of glade habitat surrounding study sites (proximity index)-had a significant effect on total plant species richness, bu...},

abstract = {Although nitrification has been well studied in coniferous forests of Western North America, communities of NH(3)-oxidizing bacteria in these forests have not been characterized. Studies were conducted along meadow-to-forest transects at two sites (Lookout and Carpenter) in the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, located in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Soil samples taken at 10- or 20-m intervals along the transects showed that several soil properties, including net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification potential rates changed significantly between vegetation zones. Nonetheless, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of the PCR-amplified NH(3) monooxygenase subunit A gene (amoA) showed the same DNA fragments (TaqI [283 bp], CfoI [66 bp], and AluI [392 bp]) to dominate {\textgreater}/=45 of 47 soil samples recovered from both sites. Two fragments (491-bp AluI [AluI491] and CfoI135) were found more frequently in meadow and transition zone soil samples than in forest samples at both sites. At the Lookout site the combination AluI491-CfoI135 was found primarily in meadow samples expressing the highest N mineralization rates. Four unique amoA sequences were identified among 15 isolates recovered into pure culture from various transect locations. Six isolates possessed the most common T-RFLP amoA fingerprint of the soil samples (TaqI283-AluI392-CfoI66), and their amoA sequences shared 99.8{\%} similarity with a cultured species, Nitrosospira sp. strain Ka4 (cluster 4). The other three amoA sequences were most similar to sequences of Nitrosospira sp. strain Nsp1 and Nitrosospira briensis (cluster 3). 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis confirmed the affiliation of these isolates with Nitrosospira clusters 3 and 4. Two amoA clone sequences matched T-RFLP fingerprints found in soil, but they were not found among the isolates.},

abstract = {Ontogenetic shifts in diet and habitat by the bluegill sunfish {\{}(Lepomis{\}} macrochirus) separate its life history into two functionally distinct stages: juveniles, which are restricted by predators to feeding in vegetated littoral habitats, and adults, which feed on zooplankton {\{}(Daphnia){\}} in the open water. Through comparative and experimental studies in natural lakes, we show how variation in Daphnia size and abundance has a strong impact on adult bluegill foraging gain and growth, and how the bluegill in turn influences Daphnia abundance and size. A two-life-stage model is used to predict how natural variation in Daphnia productivity among lakes should affect both adult and juvenile bluegill densities and growth rates. The model predicts that adult bluegill growth and density should be positively correlated among lakes, while juvenile growth and density should be negatively correlated in these same lakes. These predictions arise despite density dependence acting in each life-stage. A long-term data set on bluegill growth and abundance in a series of natural lakes supports these predictions. Finally, we consider what factors might drive variation in Daphnia abundance and size structure among lakes, and suggest that the volume (and/or productivity) of the hypolimnetic refuge available to Daphnia is a key factor. The strong interaction between adult bluegill and Daphnia, coupled with the bluegill's two-stage life history, provides an important mechanism by which the dynamics of littoral species (fish and their invertebrate resources) are coupled to the dynamics of open-water zooplankton.},

abstract = {In small lakes, juvenile sunfishes (Centrarchidae) commonly occupy vegetated habitats, reducing the risk of predation by piscivorous fish. Eight species of sunfish coexist in Lawrence Lake, Michigan, and the bluegill greatly dominates the fish fauna in terms of number sand biomass. I hypothesized that the bluegill's use of the vegetation as a predation refuge could have a significant negative effect on the growth rates of other species occupying this habitat. A @'target-neighbor@' experimental design was used to test this hypothesis. Twelve 3-m{\^{}}2 cages were arrayed linearly along the vegetated littoral zone of Lawrence Lake in 1986. Two juvenile pumpkinseeds (the @'target@' species) were placed into each cage, together with either 0, 2, 3, 6, 8, or 10 juvenile bluegills. Bluegill densities were randomly assigned to cages; average bluegill density in Lawrence Lake is equivalent to @?5 fish per cage. Growth in mass over a 50-d period was used as a measure of competitive effect. Benthic invertebrates were also sampled from each cage to determine whether fish density significantly affected invertebrate size and abundance and whether invertebrate availability influenced sunfish growth. Growth of both pumpkinseeds and bluegills declined linearly as a function of final bluegill density in the cages, indicating that the species were competing while occupying the vegetation refuge. Growth was positively related to the density of large invertebrate prey remaining at the end of the experiment. Using an optimal foraging model, I estimated the net energy return available to bluegills in each cage. Predicted net energy gains (in joules per second of foraging time) were also positively related to bluegill growth, indicating that prey availability directly influenced growth rates. Mean invertebrate size decreased significantly as fish density increased, owing to a reduction in the number of large invertebrates; the number of small prey showed no relationship to fish density. These results are consistent with a hypothesis of exploitative competition between juvenile sunfishes and indicate that the behavioral avoidance of predators by small fish can have significant effects on invertebrate size and abundance in littoral habitats.},

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between species richness and productivity is fundamental to the management and preservation of biodiversity. Yet despite years of study and intense theoretical interest, this relationship remains controversial. Here, we present the results of a literature survey in which we examined the relationship between species richness and productivity in 171 published studies. We extracted the raw data from published tables and graphs and subjected these data to a standardized analysis, using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression and generalized linear-model (GLIM) regression to test for significant positive, negative, or curvilinear relationships between productivity and species diversity. If the relationship was curvilinear, we tested whether the maximum (or minimum) of the curve occurred within the range of productivity values observed (i.e., was there evidence of a hump?). A meta-analysis conducted on the distribution of standardized quadratic regression coefficients showed that the average quadratic coefficient was negative (i.e., the average species richness-productivity relationship was curvilinear and decelerating), and that the distribution of standardized quadratic regression coefficients was significantly heterogeneous (i.e., the studies did not sample the same underlying species richness-productivity relationship). Looking more closely at the patterns of productivity-diversity relationships, we found that, for vascular plants at geographical scales smaller than continents, hump-shaped relationships occurred most frequently (41-45{\%} of all studies). A positive relationship between productivity and species richness was the next most common pattern, and positive and hump-shaped relationships co-dominated at the continental scale. For animals, positive, negative, and hump-shaped patterns were common at most geographical scales, and no one pattern predominated. For both plants and animals, hump-shaped curves were relatively more common in studies that crossed community boundaries compared to studies conducted within a community type, and plant studies that crossed community types tended to span a greater range of productivity compared to studies within community types. Sample size and plot size did not affect the probability of finding a particular productivity-diversity relationship (e.g., positive, hump-shaped, etc.). However, hump-shaped curves were especially common (65{\%}) in studies of plant diversity that used plant biomass as a measure of productivity, and in studies conducted in aquatic systems},

abstract = {Transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in four river systems in different physiographic regions of the United States was related to link magnitude by a power function, log Y = -0.84 + 1.24 log X. Multiple linear regression indicated that discharge, watershed area, and link magnitude explained almost all variation in DOC transport. For purposes of ecosystem comparison, link magnitude appeared superior to other classification systems, such as stream order. In two of the river systems, the largest fraction of DOC was transported in the spring. A third has a winter transport maximum; the last had bimodal spring and fall maxima. Streams transporting similar total amounts of DOC may vary widely in DOC concentration (mg. 1-1). Particulate organic matter concentration was not simply related to that of DOC. Ranges and means of DOC concentration, mean DOC: POC ratios, annual load of transported DOC as well as annual watershed DOC output were tabulated for 45 streams and rivers, representing a broad range of stream systems and physiographic regions. Mean DOC concentration for these 45 waterways ranged from 0.7 to 28 mg. 1-1. The very low DOC values are found in undisturbed streams; many of the higher values are associated with larger streams influenced by human activities. Most DOC outputs fell within the range 0.21-5.42 metric tons. km-2.yr-1; mean DOC:POC ranged between 0.09 and 70. A comparison was made among several biomes of the ratio of experted DOC to watershed gross and net primary production. DOC, while playing a major role in aquatic ecosystem organic budgets, appears to be of little significance in the nutrient balance of watersheds. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

Using probabilistic cellular automata models, we investigated how local frequency-dependent competition influenced whether two species could coexist. Individuals of the two species were randomly placed on a grid and allowed to interact according to local frequency-dependent rules. For four different frequency-dependent scenarios, the results indicated that over a broad parameter range the two species could coexist. Comparisons between explicit spatial simulations and the mean-field approximation indicate that coexistence occurs over a broader region in the explicit spatial simulation.},

abstract = {The study of the growth of bacterial cultures does not constitute a specialized subject or branch of research: it is the basic method of Microbiology. It would be a foolish enterprise, and doomed to failure, to attempt reviewing briefly a "subject" which covers actually our whole discipline. Unless, of course, we considered the formal laws of growth for their own sake, an approach which has repeatedly proved sterile. In the present review we shall consider bacterial growth as a method for the study of bacterial physiology and biochemistry. More precisely, we shall concern ourselves with the quantitative aspects of the method, with the interpretation of quantitative data referring to bacterial growth. Furthermore, we shall consider z exclusively the positive phases of growth, since the study of bacterial "death," i.e., of the negative phases of growth, involves distinct problems and methods. The discussion will be limited to populations considered genetically homogeneous. The problems of mutation and selection in growing cultures have been excellently dealt with in recent review articles by Delbriick (1) and Luria (2). No attempt is made at reviewing the literature on a subject which, as we have just seen, is not really a subject at all. The papers and results quoted have been selected as illustrations of the points discussed.},

abstract = {Spatial patterns of pathogen prevalence are determined by ecological processes acting across multiple spatial scales. Host-pathogen interactions are influenced by community composition, landscape structure, and environmental factors. Explaining prevalence patterns requires an understanding of how local determinants of infection, such as community composition, are mediated by landscape characteristics and regional-scale environmental drivers. Here we investigate the role of local community interactions and the effects of landscape structure on the dynamics of barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDV) in the open meadows of the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. B/CYDV is an aphid-transmitted, generalist pathogen of over 100 wild and cultivated grass species. We used variance components analysis and model selection techniques to partition the sources of variation in B/CYDV prevalence and to determine which abiotic and biotic factors influence host-pathogen interactions in a Cascades meadowsystem. B/CYDV prevalence in Cascades meadows varied by host species identity, with a significantly higher proportion of infected Festuca idahoensis individuals than Elymus glaucus or Bromus carinatus. Although there was significant variation in prevalence among host species and among meadows in the same meadow complex, there was no evidence of any significant variation in prevalence among different meadow complexes at a larger spatial scale. Variation in prevalence among meadows was primarily associated with the local community context (host identity, the relative abundance of different host species, and host species richness) and the physical landscape attributes of the meadow. These results highlight the importance of local host community composition, mediated by landscape characteristics such as meadow aspect, as a determinant of the spatial pattern of infection of a multi-host pathogen.},

abstract = {Pathogens, like other consumers, mediate the outcome of competitive interactions between their host species. Ongoing efforts to integrate pathogens into plant community ecology could be accelerated by greater conceptual unification. Research on plant pathogens has mainly focused on a variety of disparate mechanisms—the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, plant-soil feedbacks, competition-defense trade-offs, escape of invasive plants from their enemies, and epidemic-driven community shifts—with limited recognition of how these mechanisms fit into the broader context of plant coexistence. Here, I extend an emerging theoretical framework for understanding species coexistence to include various pathogen impacts on plant communities. Pathogens can promote coexistence by regulating relative abundance or by reducing the disparities between species in fitness that make coexistence more difficult. Conversely, pathogens may undermine coexistence by creating positive feedbacks or by increasing between-species fitness differences. I review the evidence for these pathogen mediated mechanisms, and I reframe the major hypotheses in a community ecology context in order to understand how the mechanisms are related. This approach generates predictions about how various modes of pathogen attack affect plant coexistence, even when direct impacts on host relative abundance are difficult to measure. Surprisingly, no study gives direct empirical evidence for pathogen effects on mutual invasibility, a key criterion for coexistence. Future studies should investigate the relationship between pathogen attack and host relative abundance, in order to distinguish between mechanisms.},

abstract = {Theory predicts that productivity and the relative efficiency of resource utilization determine the outcome of interactions between intraguild predators and prey. Interactions between two freshwater protists, Colpidium striatum (the intraguild prey) and Blepharisma americanum (the intraguild predator), in laboratory microcosms support the predictions of intraguild predation theory. Colpidium competitively excluded Blepharisma when bacterial production was low, even though Blepharisma had a potential advantage conferred by its ability to consume Colpidium. In contrast to competitive exclusion at low productivity, Colpidium and Blepharisma coexisted for many generations at higher levels of bacterial production. Theory predicts a similar transition from competitive exclusion to coexistence as productivity increases, if intraguild predators use resources less efficiently than intraguild prey/competitors. Other experiments showed that Colpidium depresses bacterial densities more than Blepharisma, a result consistent with greater efficiency of resource utilization by Colpidium. These results indicate that simple mathematical models can provide important insights into the population dynamics of intraguild predators and prey under different levels of productivity.},

abstract = {Dispersal is a key process in metacommunity dynamics, allowing the maintenance of diversity in complex community networks. Geographic distance is usually used as a surrogate for connectivity implying that communities that are closely located are considered more prone to exchange individuals than distant communities. However, in some natural systems, organisms may be subjected to directional dispersal (air or water flows, particular landscape configuration), possibly leading close communities to be isolated from each other and distant communities to be connected. Using geographic distance as a proxy for realised connectivity may then yield misleading results regarding the role of dispersal in structuring communities in such systems. Here, we quantified the relative importance of flow connectivity, geographic distance, and environmental gradients to explain polychaete metacommunity structure along the coasts of the Gulf of Lions (northwest Mediterranean Sea). Flow connectivity was estimated by Lagrangian particle dispersal simulations. Our results revealed that this metacommunity is strongly structured by the environment at large spatial scales, and that both flow connectivity and geographic distance play an important role within homogeneous environments at smaller spatial scales. We thus strongly advocate for a wider use of connectivity measures, in addition to geographic distance, to study spatial patterns of biological diversity (e.g. distance decay) and to infer the processes behind these patterns at different spatial scales.},

abstract = {Conservative solute injections were conducted in three first-order montane streams of different geological composition to assess the influence of parent lithology and alluvial characteristics on the hydrological retention of nutrients. Three study sites were established: (1) Aspen Creek, in a sandstone-siltstone catchment with a fine-grained alluvium of low hydraulic conductivity (1.3 x 10(-4) cm/s), (2) Rio Calaveras, which flows through volcanic tuff with alluvium of intermediate grain size and hydraulic conductivity (1.2 x 10(-3) cm/s), and (3) Gallina Creek, located in a granite/gneiss catchment of coarse, poorly sorted alluvium with high hydraulic conductivity (4.1 x 10(-3) cm/s). All sites were instrumented with networks of shallow groundwater wells to monitor interstitial solute transport. The rate and extent of groundwater-surface water exchange, determined by the solute response in wells, increased with increasing hydraulic conductivity. The direction of surface water-groundwater interaction within a stream was related to local variation in vertical and horizontal hydraulic gradients. Experimental tracer responses in the surface stream were simulated with a one-dimensional solute transport model with inflow and storage components (OTIS). Model-derived measures of hydrological retention showed a corresponding increase with increasing hydraulic conductivity. To assess the temporal variability of hydrological retention, solute injection experiments were conducted in Gallina Creek under four seasonal flow regimes during which surface discharge ranged from baseflow (0.75 l/s in October) to high (75 l/s during spring snowmelt). Model-derived hydrological retention decreased with increasing discharge. The results of our intersite comparison suggest that hydrological retention is strongly influenced by the geologic setting and alluvial characteristics of the stream catchment. Temporal variation in hydrological retention at Gallina Creek is related to seasonal changes in discharge, highlighting the need for temporal resolution in studies of the dynamics of surface water-groundwater interactions in stream ecosystems.

The results show that communities built from species-rich pools develop more slowly to invasion-resistant states. Fewer basal species are found locally where species are rich in consumers, although specialization by the consumers for different kinds of prey enables more basal species to exist locally. The invasion-resistant states eventually achieved by such an assembly process may be single communities or cyclic sequences of communities uninvadable by species not in the cycle. These endstates of assembly are properties of the species pool, and the form they take depends on the nature of the pool. If made rich enough, species pools cause saturation of local communities such that the number of species present locally becomes uncoupled from the richness of the pool.},

abstract = {Population dynamics and evolutionary dynamics can occur on similar time scales, and a coupling of these two processes can lead to novel population dynamics. Recent theoretical studies of coevolving predator-prey systems have concentrated more on the stability of such systems than on the characteristics of cycles when they are unstable. Here I explore the characteristics of the cycles that arise due to coevolution in a system in which prey can increase their ability to escape from predators by becoming either significantly larger or significantly smaller in trait value (i.e.,a bidirectional trait axis). This is a reasonable model of body size evolution in some systems. The results show that antiphase population cycles and cryptic cycles (large population fluctuation in one species but almost no change in another species) can occur in the coevolutionary system but not systems where only a single species evolves. Previously, those dynamical patterns have only been theoretically shown to occur in single species evolutionary models and the coevolutionary model which do not involve a bi-directional axis of adaptation. These unusual dynamics may be observed in predator-prey interactions when the density dependence in the prey species is strong. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We studied a prey-predator system in which both species evolve. We discuss here the conditions that result in coevolution towards a stable equilibrium or towards oscillations. First, we show that a stable equilibrium or population oscillations with small amplitude is likely to occur if the prey's (host's) defence is effective when compared with the predator's (parasite's) attacking ability at equilibrium, whereas large-amplitude oscillations are likely if the predator's (parasite's) attacking ability exceeds the prey's (host's) defensive ability. Second, a stable equilibrium is more likely if the prey's defensive trait evolves faster than the predator's attack trait, whereas population oscillations are likely if the predator's trait evolves faster than that of the prey. Third, when the adaptation rates of both species are similar, the amplitude of the fluctuations in their abundances is small when the adaptation rate is either very slow or very fast, but at an intermediate rate of adaptation the fluctuations have a large amplitude. We also show the case in which the prey's abundance and trait fluctuate greatly, while those of the predator remain almost unchanged. Our results predict that populations and traits in host-parasite systems are more likely than those in prey-predator systems to show large-amplitude oscillations.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the predator-prey coevolutionary dynamics when a preys defense and a predators offense change in an adaptive manner, either by genetic evolution or phenotypic plasticity, or by behavioral choice. Results are: (1) The coevolutionary dynamics are more likely to be stable if the predator adapts faster than the prey. (2) The prey population size can be nearly constant but the predator population can show very large amplitude fluctuations. (3) Both populations may oscillate in antiphase. All of these are not observed when the handling time is short and the preys density dependence is weak. (4) The population dynamics and the trait dynamics show resonance: the amplitude of the population fluctuation is the largest when the speed of adaptation is intermediate. These results may explain experimental studies with microorganisms. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Many previous studies have assumed that a linear relationship between local and regional species richness indicates that communities are limited by regional processes, while a saturating relationship suggests that species interactions restrict local richness. We show theoretically that the relationship between local and regional richness changes in a consistent fashion with assembly time in interacting communities. Communities show saturation in their early assembly stages because only a subset of the regional pool may colonize a locality. At intermediate assembly times, communities will appear unsaturated until significant competitive exclusion occurs. Finally, when communities reach equilibrium, we found saturation as a result of resource competition resulting in the dominance of a limited number of species. We show that habitat size and species fecundity are important in determining the time needed for the community to reach equilibrium and thus affect the relationship between local and regional species richness. Our results suggest the number of coexisting species is a function of local and regional processes whose relative influences might vary over time and that research using the relationship between local and regional species richness to infer mechanisms limiting species richness must have knowledge of the assembly time of the community},

abstract = {Although the influence of dispersal on coexistence mechanisms in metacommunities has received great emphasis, few studies have addressed how such influence is affected varying regional heterogeneity. We present a mechanistic model of resource competition in a metacommunity based on classical models of plant competition for limiting resources. We defined regional heterogeneity as the differences in resource supply rates (or resource availabilities) across local communities. As suggested by previous work, the highest diversify occurred at intermediate levels of dispersal among local communities. However our model shows how the effects of dispersal depend on the amount of heterogeneity among local communities and vice versa. Both regional and local species richness were the highest when heterogeneity was intermediate. We suggest that empirical studies that found no evidence for source?sink or mass effects at the community level may have examined communities with limited ranges of dispersal and regional heterogeneity. This model of species coexistence contributes to a broader understanding of patterns in real communities.},

Here, we introduce the concept of keystone communities (and ecosystems) within metacommunities (and metaecosystems). We define keystone and burden communities as communities with impacts disproportionately large (positive or negative respectively) relative to their weight in the metacommunity. We show how a simple metric, based on the effects of single-community removals, can characterise communities along a 'keystoneness' axis. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach with examples from two different theoretical models. We further distinguish environmental heterogeneity from species trait heterogeneity as determinants of keystoneness. We suggest that the concept of keystone communities/ecosystems will be highly beneficial, not only as a fundamental step towards understanding species interactions in a spatial context, but also as a tool for the management of disturbed landscapes.},

abstract = {In an era filled with fears of bioterrorism, Congress approved the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREPA) to encourage development of vaccines and other countermeasures. By providing pharmaceutical manufacturers with protection from liability for potential side effects, Congress has attempted to motivate manufacturers to produce a national stockpile of countermeasures. As part of PREPA, the government established a compensatory system intended to provide compensation to persons injured by countermeasures used during a public health emergency. Although the Act provides for a compensation fund, it fails to allocate monies for that fund. Thus, in the absence of further congressional action, PREPA will not provide compensation to those injured by countermeasures. Failing to assure the American public of a compensation program constitutes bad public policy and risks inspiring potential vaccinees to refuse necessary drugs. Additionally, arguments as to the constitutionality of the Act exist should Congress fail to adequately fund the program, and the existence of those arguments undermines the purpose of the Act-namely to assure pharmaceutical manufacturers that they will not be sued into oblivion should they attempt to aid national pandemic protection. In addition to detailing both the Act and the statutory precedent for congressional attempts to spur biodefense, this Article addresses important issues of healthcare, tort, and constitutional law that will continue to manifest themselves in this new era of bioterrorism.},

Although the conditions of local and regional coexistence have been well defined in such systems, no study has attempted to provide clear predictions of classical community-wide patterns. Here we provide predictions for species richness, species relative abundances, and community-level functional properties (productivity and space occupation) at the local and regional scales as functions of the proportion of dispersal between communities. Local (alpha) diversity is maximal at an intermediate level of dispersal, whereas between-community (beta) and regional (gamma) diversity decline as dispersal increases because of increased homogenization of the metacommunity. The relationships between local and regional species richness and the species rank abundance distributions are strongly affected by the level of dispersal. Local productivity and space occupation tend to decline as dispersal increases, resulting in either a hump-shaped or a positive relationship between species richness and productivity, depending on the scale considered (local or regional). These effects of dispersal are buffered by decreasing species dispersal success. Our results provide a niche-based alternative to the recent neutral-metacommunity model and have important implications for conservation biology and landscape management.},

abstract = {1. We studied whole-ecosystem metabolism in eight streams from several biomes in North America to identify controls on the rate of stream metabolism over a large geographic range. The streams studied had climates ranging from tropical to cool-temperate and from humid to arid and were all relatively uninfluenced by human disturbances. 2. Rates of gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R) and net ecosystem production (NEP) were determined using the open-system, two-station diurnal oxygen change method. 3. Three general patterns in metabolism were evident among streams: (1) relatively high GPP with positive NEP (i.e. net oxygen production) in early afternoon, (2) moderate primary production with a distinct peak in GPP during daylight but negative NEP at all times and (3) little or no evidence of GPP during daylight and a relatively constant and negative NEP over the entire day. 4. Gross primary production was most strongly correlated with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). A multiple regression model that included log PAR and stream water soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration explained 90{\%} of the variation in log GPP. 5. Ecosystem respiration was significantly correlated with SRP concentration and size of the transient storage zone and, together, these factors explained 73{\%} of the variation in R. The rate of R was poorly correlated with the rate of GPP. 6. Net ecosystem production was significantly correlated only with PAR, with 53{\%} of the variation in log NEP explained by log PAR. Only Sycamore Creek, a desert stream in Arizona, had positive NEP (GPP: R{\textgreater}1), supporting the idea that streams are generally net sinks rather than net sources of organic matter.},

abstract = {We measured uptake length of (NO3)-N-15- in 72 streams in eight regions across the United States and Puerto Rico to develop quantitative predictive models on controls of NO3- uptake length. As part of the Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment II project, we chose nine streams in each region corresponding to natural (reference), suburban-urban, and agricultural land uses. Study streams spanned a range of human land use to maximize variation in NO3- concentration, geomorphology, and metabolism. We tested a causal model predicting controls on NO3- uptake length using structural equation modeling. The model included concomitant measurements of ecosystem metabolism, hydraulic parameters, and nitrogen concentration. We compared this structural equation model to multiple regression models which included additional biotic, catchment, and riparian variables. The structural equation model explained 79{\%} of the variation in log uptake length (S-Wtot). Uptake length increased with specific discharge (Q/w) and increasing NO3- concentrations, showing a loss in removal efficiency in streams with high NO3- concentration. Uptake lengths shortened with increasing gross primary production, suggesting autotrophic assimilation dominated NO3- removal. The fraction of catchment area as agriculture and suburban urban land use weakly predicted NO3- uptake in bivariate regression, and did improve prediction in a set of multiple regression models. Adding land use to the structural equation model showed that land use indirectly affected NO3- uptake lengths via directly increasing both gross primary production and NO3- concentration. Gross primary production shortened SWtot, while increasing NO3- lengthened SWtot resulting in no net effect of land use on NO3- removal.},

Analysis of P-33:H-3 ratio profiles from (PO4)-P-33 and (H2O)-H-3 injection experiments indicated that P uptake within the transient storage zone accounted for similar to 43{\%} of the total P uptake in HWC but was negligible in WE, explaining, in part, the difference in total P uptake rate between these streams. The higher rate of P uptake in the surface zone, shorter P uptake length, and larger ratio of P uptake:respiration in HWC compared with WE suggest that the microbial community in HWC exerts a greater demand for and has a greater affinity for streamwater P presumably as a result of a greater supply of labile organic matter and/or lower nutrient levels in HWC.},

abstract = {Microbial biogeography is influenced by the combined effects of passive dispersal and environmental selection, but the contribution of either factor can be difficult to discern. As thermophilic bacteria cannot grow in the cold seabed, their inactive spores are not subject to environmental selection. We therefore conducted a global experimental survey using thermophilic endospores that are passively deposited by sedimentation to the cold seafloor as tracers to study the effect of dispersal by ocean currents on the biogeography of marine microorganisms. Our analysis of 81 different marine sediments from around the world identified 146 species-level 16S rRNA phylotypes of endospore-forming, thermophilic Firmicutes. Phylotypes showed various patterns of spatial distribution in the world oceans and were dispersal-limited to different degrees. Co-occurrence of several phylotypes in locations separated by great distances (west of Svalbard, the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of California) demonstrated a widespread but not ubiquitous distribution. In contrast, Arctic regions with water masses that are relatively isolated from global ocean circulation (Baffin Bay and east of Svalbard) were characterized by low phylotype richness and different compositions of phylotypes. The observed distribution pattern of thermophilic endospores in marine sediments suggests that the impact of passive dispersal on marine microbial biogeography is controlled by the connectivity of local water masses to ocean circulation.},

abstract = {The method of calculation is shown wherebt a formula has been derived that approximately the ratio of the rate of accumulation of advantageous mutant genes in a population that undergoes recombination to the rate in an otherwise non-recombining one. A table is given showing the ratios thus found for different frequencies of advantageous mutations and different degrees of their advantage. It is shown that this calculation does not apply for mutant genes that act advantageously only when in some special combinations with one or more other mutant genes, and that as far as these cases of special synergism are concerned recombining lines have no evolutionary advantage over non-recombining ones. Other limitations of the formula are pointed out and assessed. It is explained that most factors that retard the rate of recombination—for expample, linkage, rarity of outbreeding, intercalation of sexual reproduction between more frequent cycles of sexual propagation, and partial isolation between subpopulations—must usually cause little long-term retardation of the speed of advance that is fostered by recombination. Moreover, even where long-term evolutions has virtually ceased, recombination of mutant genes still confers upon a population the means of adopting short-term genetic “dodges”, that adjust it to ecological and “physical” changes in its circumstances, much more rapidly than would be possible for a comparable asexual population. Under conditions where only stability of type is needed, a non-recombining does not actually degenerate as a result of an excess of mutation over selection, after the usual equilibrium between these pressures is reached. However, a irreversible ratchet mechanism exists in the non-recombining species (unlike the recombining ones) that prevents selection, even if intensified, from reducing the mutational loads below the lightest that were in existence when the intensified selection started, whereas, contrariwise, “drift”, and what might be called “selective noise” must allow occasional slips of the lightest loads in the direction of increased weight.},

Both organisms affect the composition and dynamics of microbial communities in the soil. However, M. xanthus is known to be a predator while B. subtilis is not. A screen of various prey led to the finding that M. xanthus is capable of consuming laboratory strains of B. subtilis while the ancestral strain, NCIB3610, was resistant to predation. Based in part on recent characterization of several strains of B. subtilis, we were able to determine that the pks gene cluster, required for production of bacillaene, is the major factor allowing B. subtilis NCIB3610 cells to resist predation by M. xanthus. Furthermore, purified bacillaene was added exogenously to domesticated strains resulting in resistance to predation. Lastly, we found that M. xanthus is incapable of consuming B. subtilis spores even from laboratory strains, indicating the evolutionary fitness of sporulation as a survival strategy. Together, the results suggest that bacillaene inhibits M. xanthus predation allowing sufficient time for development of B. subtilis spores.},

abstract = {Biofilm formation is a common mechanism for surviving environmental stress and can be triggered by both intraspecies and interspecies interactions. Prolonged predator-prey interactions between the soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus and Bacillus subtilis were found to induce the formation of a new type of B. subtilis biofilm, termed megastructures. Megastructures are tree-like brachiations that are as large as 500 $\mu$m in diameter, are raised above the surface between 150 and 200 $\mu$m, and are filled with viable endospores embedded within a dense matrix. Megastructure formation did not depend on TasA, EpsE, SinI, RemA, or surfactin production and thus is genetically distinguishable from colony biofilm formation on MSgg medium. As B. subtilis endospores are not susceptible to predation by M. xanthus, megastructures appear to provide an alternative mechanism for survival. In addition, M. xanthus fruiting bodies were found immediately adjacent to the megastructures in nearly all instances, suggesting that M. xanthus is unable to acquire sufficient nutrients from cells housed within the megastructures. Lastly, a B. subtilis mutant lacking the ability to defend itself via bacillaene production formed megastructures more rapidly than the parent. Together, the results indicate that production of the megastructure facilitates B. subtilis escape into dormancy via sporulation.},

abstract = {A general predator is assumed to divide its hunting time between two sub-habitats with different prey species, spending a larger fraction ($\phi$) of search time in an area as the relative prey abundance there increases. This always causes switching in the model, and changes a functional response from one that imposes a risk on the average prey that decreases with prey density in the direction of one that imposes an increasing risk. I discuss the conditions for a response that is density dependent, and those predatory attributes that make such a response more likely. Transit time between subhabitats always increases the density dependent effect, and is necessary for “system stability” in a Lotka-Volterra model with two prey species. Experiments have confirmed the model's basic assumption. General predators do not fit easily into classical predator-prey models of simple “closed” communities, and then the degree of density dependence of the functional response becomes a useful measure of a predator's short-term stabilizing effect on a prey species. The model demonstrates how spatial heterogeneity can be stabilizing.},

abstract = {We describe a new molecular approach to analyzing the genetic diversity of complex microbial populations. This technique is based on the separation of polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments of genes coding for 16S rRNA, all the same length, by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DGGE analysis of different microbial communities demonstrated the presence of up to 10 distinguishable bands in the separation pattern, which were most likely derived from as many different species constituting these populations, and thereby generated a DGGE profile of the populations. We showed that it is possible to identify constituents which represent only 1{\%} of the total population. With an oligonucleotide probe specific for the V3 region of 16S rRNA of sulfate-reducing bacteria, particular DNA fragments from some of the microbial populations could be identified by hybridization analysis. Analysis of the genomic DNA from a bacterial biofilm grown under aerobic conditions suggests that sulfate-reducing bacteria, despite their anaerobicity, were present in this environment. The results we obtained demonstrate that this technique will contribute to our understanding of the genetic diversity of uncharacterized microbial populations.},

abstract = {1.Ecological disturbances are often hypothesized to alter community assembly processes that influence variation in community composition ($\beta$-diversity). Disturbance can cause convergence in community composition (low $\beta$-diversity) by increasing niche selection of disturbance-tolerant species. Alternatively, disturbance can cause divergence in community composition (high $\beta$-diversity) by increasing habitat filtering across environmental gradients. However, because disturbance may also influence $\beta$-diversity through random sampling effects owing to changes in the number of individuals in local communities (community size) or abundances in the regional species pool, observed patterns of $\beta$-diversity alone cannot be used to unambiguously discern the relative importance of community assembly mechanisms. 2.We compared $\beta$-diversity of woody plants and inferred assembly mechanisms among unburned forests and forests managed with prescribed fires in the Missouri Ozarks, USA. Using a null-model approach, we compared how environmental gradients influenced $\beta$-diversity after controlling for differences in local community size and regional species abundances between unburned and burned landscapes. 3.Observed $\beta$-diversity was higher in burned landscapes. However, this pattern disappeared or reversed after controlling for smaller community size in burned landscapes. 4.$\beta$-diversity was higher than expected by chance in both landscapes, indicating an important role for processes that create clumped species distributions. Moreover, fire appeared to decrease clumping of species at broader spatial scales, suggesting homogenization of community composition through niche selection of disturbance-tolerant species. Environmental variables, however, explained similar amounts of variation in $\beta$-diversity in both landscapes, suggesting that disturbance did not alter the relative importance of habitat filtering. 5.Our results indicate that contingent responses of communities to fire reflect a combination of fire-induced changes in local community size and scale-dependent effects of fire on species clumping across landscapes. 6.Synthesis. Although niche-based mechanisms of community assembly are often invoked to explain changes in community composition following disturbance, our results suggest that these changes also arise through random sampling effects owing to the influence of disturbance on community size. Comparative studies of these processes across disturbed ecosystems will provide important insights into the ecological conditions that determine when disturbance alters the interplay of deterministic and stochastic processes in natural and human-modified landscapes.

abstract = {Using the statistical analysis of genetic variation, we have developed a high-resolution genetic map of recombination hotspots and recombination rate variation across the human genome. This map, which has a resolution several orders of magnitude greater than previous studies, identifies over 25,000 recombination hotspots and gives new insights into the distribution and determination of recombination. Wavelet-based analysis demonstrates scale-specific influences of base composition, coding context and DNA repeats on recombination rates, though, in contrast with other species, no association with DNase I hypersensitivity. We have also identified specific DNA motifs that are strongly associated with recombination hotspots and whose activity is influenced by local context. Comparative analysis of recombination rates in humans and chimpanzees demonstrates very high rates of evolution of the fine-scale structure of the recombination landscape. In the light of these observations, we suggest possible resolutions of the hotspot paradox.},

We present a high-resolution genetic map of the human genome, based on statistical analyses of genetic variation data, and identify more than 25,000 recombination hotspots, together with motifs and sequence contexts that play a role in hotspot activity. Differences between the behavior of recombination rates over large (megabase) and small (kilobase) scales lead us to suggest a two-stage model for recombination in which hotspots are stochastic features, within a framework in which large-scale rates are constrained.},

abstract = {Biofilms are densely packed communities of microbial cells that grow on surfaces and surround themselves with secreted polymers. Many bacterial species form biofilms, and their study has revealed them to be complex and diverse. The structural and physiological complexity of biofilms has led to the idea that they are coordinated and cooperative groups, analogous to multicellular organisms. We evaluate this idea by addressing the findings of microbiologists from the perspective of sociobiology, including theories of collective behavior (self-organization) and social evolution. This yields two main conclusions. First, the appearance of organization in biofilms can emerge without active coordination. That is, biofilm properties such as phenotypic differentiation, species stratification and channel formation do not necessarily require that cells communicate with one another using specialized signaling molecules. Second, while local cooperation among bacteria may often occur, the evolution of cooperation among all cells is unlikely for most biofilms. Strong conflict can arise among multiple species and strains in a biofilm, and spontaneous mutation can generate conflict even within biofilms initiated by genetically identical cells. Biofilms will typically result from a balance between competition and cooperation, and we argue that understanding this balance is central to building a complete and predictive model of biofilm formation.},

The objectives of this article are to briefly review the traditional view of hierarchical physical controls on stream structure and dynamics and to show how this viewpoint is changing as recognition of strong biological influences on physical structure are emerging. In combination, identifying natural stream characteristics and the interactions among individual components, as well as recognizing the importance of biotic feedbacks on physical structure, form the basis for establishing effective conservation strategies.},

Periphyton from pools and riffles, aquatic moss (Fortinalis), fine particulate organic matter (FPOM: 0.5 um-1 cm), and coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM: greater than 1 cm) were examined separately for gross production (GP), net community production (NCP), diel respiration (R24), net daily metabolism (NDM), and the production to respiration (P:R) ratio. Total autotrophic production was found to increase in a downstream direction where more light is available. Detrital metabolism, per unit weight, is similar in all streams. The standing stock of detritus though, is highest in headwater streams. On an areal basis periphyton metabolism is much greater than detrital metabolism and, as a consequence, total stream metabolism and the P:R ratio increase downstream Gross prodution rates measured for these sites are some of the lowerst recorded. Rates are compared to those from other streams in the northwestern U.S. and western Canada.},

abstract = {Geomorphological processes that commonly transport soil down hillslopes and sediment and woody debris through stream systems in steep, mountainous, forest landscapes can operate in sequence down gravitational ¯owpaths, forming a cascade of disturbance processes that alters stream and riparian ecosystems. The aected stream and riparian landscape can be viewed through time as a network containing a shifting mosaic of disturbance patches Ð linear zones of disturbance created by the cascading geomorphological processes. Ecological disturbances range in severity from eects of debris ¯ows, which completely remove alluvium, riparian soil and vegetation along steep, narrow, low-order channels, to localized patches of trees toppled by ¯oating logs along the margins of larger channels. Land-use practices can aect the cascade of geomorphological processes that function as disturbance agents by changing the frequency and spatial pattern of events and the quantity and size distribution of material moved. A characterization of the disturbance regime in a stream network has important implications for ecological analysis. The network structure of stream and riparian systems, for example, may lend resilience in response to major disturbances by providing widely distributed refuges. An understanding of disturbance regime is a foundation for designing management systems.},

In this paper, we will consider the models proposed by Gurney {\&} Nisbet (1975), from those points of view. We will show that, if a population is dispersing in a highly density-dependent manner, a stationary distribution which does not depend on boundary conditions is established in a finite region by interactions between the population and a heterogeneous environment. We will also show that, even when a population is confined in a habitat with a limited size a population dispersing density-dependently can establish a stationary distribution, whereas a population dispersing randomly either goes to extinction or grows explosively.},

MacArthur suggested that if we could see the entire, unveiled distribution of abundances in the assemblage, we would discover that the distribution is left-skewed. This suggestion takes on a particular interest because, as we will show, Sugihara's so-far successful model of abundance patterns predicts that abundance distributions are more likely to be left- than right-skewed. Recently published estimates of the population sizes of British bird species allow us to observe the completely unveiled distribution of a natural assemblage. This data set is, perhaps, uniquely informative because of the accuracy of the population size estimates of rare British bird species. The distribution is indeed left-skewed and the degree of left-skewness is quantitatively compatible with Sugihara's model.},

Integrodifference equations contain two components: (1) difference equations, which model growth and interactions during a sedentary stage, and (2) redistribution kernels, which characterize the distribution of dispersal distances that arise during a vagile stage. Redistribution kernels have been measured for a tremendous number of organisms. We derive a number of redistribution kernels from first principles. Integrodifference equations generate pattern under a far broader set of ecological conditions than do reaction-diffusion models.

A s a measure of organic carbon spiralling, we introduce organic carbon turnover length, S, defined as the average or expected downstream distance travelled by a carbon atom between its entry or fixation in the stream and its oxidation. Using a simple model for organic carbon dynamics in a stream, we show that S is closely related to Fisher and Likens' ecosystem efficiency. Unlike efficiency, however, S is independent of the length of the study reach,and values of S determmcd in streams of differing lengths can be compared. Using data trom three different streams, we found the relationship between S and efficiency to agree closely with the model prediction. Hypotheses of stream functioning are dis- cussed in the context of organic carbon spiralling theory.},

abstract = {Nutrient cycling in streams occurs in conjunction with downstream transport as a spatially distributed process that has been termed spiralling. The intensity of reutilization of nutrients as they pass downstream can be quantified in terms of the length of stream required for a nutrient atom to complete one (abstract) cycle ("spiralling length'). A model for steady-state spiralling of a limiting nutrient predicts that most of the downstream transport of nutrient occurs in particulate or unavailable form when nutrient limitation is severe; transportability of particulates is a major determinant of spiralling length. When nutrient limitation is moderated by density-dependent mechanisms, however, transport in the dissolved phase dominates, and transportability of particles has little influence on spiralling length. Functional processes of invertebrate grazing and filter feeding are most likely to shorten spiralling length when nutrient limitation is severe; shredding is more likely to shorten spiralling length when nutrient limitation is weak. -from Authors},

abstract = {We estimated deposition and resuspension rates of natural particulate organic matter (POM) in Bloomington Creek, Idaho, a mountain stream flowing at 225 L s 21 . POM was collected from the water column, fractionated into two size classes— very fine POM (VFPOM, 15-52 mm) and fine POM (FPOM, 53-106mm), and radiolabeled by using 14 C-dimethylsulfate. The labeled particles in each size class and a conservative tracer were released to the stream in metered pulses and then sampled from the water column at six stations extending 1 km downstream for 4 d. Deposition and resuspension rates were estimated by fitting a one-dimensional advection-dispersion model to 14 C-concentrations measured during and after release. Model-estimated deposition velocities were 0.12 (0.09-0.16, 95{\%} confidence interval) and 0.18 (0.10-0.31) mm s 21 for VFPOM and FPOM, respectively. There was some (;0.05 mm s 21 ) additional short-term (;20 min) detention of VFPOM and FPOM that may have been related to transient storage. For VFPOM, 34{\%} of deposited particles resuspended after a mean residence time of 13 (6.9-25) h, and the remainder resuspended with a residence time of 7.5 (2.9-19) d. For FPOM, these estimates were 17{\%}, 2.4 (1.0-4.9) h, and 2.6 (1.7-4.0) d, respectively. The weighted mean residence times and downstream velocities of particle migration were 5.1 d and 150 m d 21 for VFPOM, and 2.2 d and 230 m d 21 for FPOM. The migration velocities suggest that a significant fraction of particles exported from headwater streams travel long distances and can reach larger riverine or marine environments before mineralization.},

abstract = {Theoretical development in the field of community ecology needs ground proofing with empirical tests. In addition, these tests need to be continuously updated. Cottenie (2005) linked observed metacommunities to theoretical models based on whether environmental and/or spatial effects in the observed metacommunity significantly explain community structure. However, a species-sorting metacommunity with high dispersal and one with limited dispersal cannot be distinguished in this manner; both produce significant environmental and spatial effects. In the present study, we demonstrate a solution to this problem using a zooplankton rock pool metacommunity in Churchill, Manitoba, sampled in August 2006. We established a hierarchy of metacommunities in the Churchill rock bluff system—a large, across-bluff metacommunity, and small, within-bluff metacommunities. Using this spatial hierarchy, it is possible to determine the zooplankton dispersal capability in the rock bluff system and hence to link the metacommunity to its corresponding model. We found the zooplankton rock bluff system to exhibit limited dispersal, meaning that spatial effects were significant at the across-bluff scale, but depending on the bluff, were significant or insignificant at the within-bluff scale. Environmental effects were significant at both scales. This study demonstrates a novel way to determine dispersal capabilities in species that are cryptic dispersers, and to successfully link observed metacommunities with theoretical models.},

abstract = {Hydrochory, or the passive dispersal of organisms by water, is an important means of propagule transport, especially for plants. During recent years, knowledge about hydrochory and its ecological consequences has increased considerably and a substantial body of literature has been produced. Here, we review this literature and define the state of the art of the discipline. A substantial proportion of species growing in or near water have propagules (fruits, seeds or vegetative units) able to disperse by water, either floating, submerged in flowing water, or with the help of floating vessels. Hydrochory can enable plants to colonize sites out of reach with other dispersal vectors, but the timing of dispersal and mechanisms of establishment are important for successful establishment. At the population level, hydrochory may increase the effective size and longevity of populations, and control their spatial configuration. Hydrochory is also an important source of species colonizing recruitment-limited riparian and wetland communities, contributing to maintenance of community species richness. Dispersal by water may even influence community composition in different landscape elements, resulting in landscape-level patterns. Genetically, hydrochory may reduce spatial aggregation of genetically related individuals, lead to high gene flow among populations, and increase genetic diversity in populations receiving many propagules. Humans have impacted hydrochory in many ways. For example, dams affect hydrochory by reducing peak flows and hence dispersal capacity, altering the timing of dispersal, and by presenting physical barriers to dispersal, with consequences for riverine plant communities. Hydrochory has been inferred to be an important vector for the spread of many invasive species, but there is also the potential for enhancing ecosystem restoration by improving or restoring water dispersal pathways. Climate change may alter the role of hydrochory by modifying the hydrology of water-bodies as well as conditions for propagule release and plant colonization.},

abstract = {Dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory offers a perspective on population ecology whose starting point is energy utilization by, and homeostasis within, individual organisms. It is natural to ask what it adds to the existing large body of individual-based ecological theory. We approach this question pragmatically--through detailed study of the individual physiology and population dynamics of the zooplankter Daphnia and its algal food. Standard DEB theory uses several state variables to characterize the state of an individual organism, thereby making the transition to population dynamics technically challenging, while ecologists demand maximally simple models that can be used in multi-scale modelling. We demonstrate that simpler representations of individual bioenergetics with a single state variable (size), and two life stages (juveniles and adults), contain sufficient detail on mass and energy budgets to yield good fits to data on growth, maturation and reproduction of individual Daphnia in response to food availability. The same simple representations of bioenergetics describe some features of Daphnia mortality, including enhanced mortality at low food that is not explicitly incorporated in the standard DEB model. Size-structured, population models incorporating this additional mortality component resolve some long-standing questions on stability and population cycles in Daphnia. We conclude that a bioenergetic model serving solely as a 'regression' connecting organismal performance to the history of its environment can rest on simpler representations than those of standard DEB. But there are associated costs with such pragmatism, notably loss of connection to theory describing interspecific variation in physiological rates. The latter is an important issue, as the type of detailed study reported here can only be performed for a handful of species.},

The purpose of this article is to describe one good strategy for carrying out computational experiments. I will not describe profound issues such as how to formulate hypotheses, design experiments, or draw conclusions. Rather, I will focus on relatively mundane issues such as organizing files and directories and documenting progress. These issues are important because poor organizational choices can lead to significantly slower research progress. I do not claim that the strategies I outline here are optimal. These are simply the principles and practices that I have developed over 12 years of bioinformatics research, augmented with various suggestions from other researchers with whom I have discussed these issues.},

abstract = {The neocortex of the adult brain consists of neurons and glia that are generated by precursor cells of the embryonic ventricular zone. In general, glia are generated after neurons during development(1), but radial glia are an exception to this rule. Radial glia are generated before neurogenesis and guide neuronal migration(2). Radial glia are mitotically active throughout neurogenesis(3), and disappear or become astrocytes when neuronal migration is complete(4,5). Although the lineage relationships of cortical neurons and glia have been explored(6,7), the clonal relationship of radial glia to other cortical cells remains unknown. It has been suggested that radial glia may be neuronal precursors(5,8-10), but this has not been demonstrated in vivo. We have used a retroviral vector encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein to label precursor cells in vivo and have examined clones 1-3 days later using morphological, immunohistochemical and electrophysiological techniques. Here we show that clones consist of mitotic radial glia and postmitotic neurons, and that neurons migrate along clonally related radial glia. Time-lapse images show that proliferative radial glia generate neurons. Our results support the concept that a lineage relationship between neurons and proliferative radial glia may underlie the radial organization of neocortex.},

abstract = {Complexity theory illuminates the many interactions between natural and social systems, providing a better understanding of the general principles that can help solve some of today's most pressing environmental issues. Complexity theory was developed from key ideas in economics, physics, biology, and the social sciences and contributes to important new concepts for approaching issues of environmental sustainability such as resilience, scaling, and networks. Complexity Theory for a Sustainable Futureis a hands-on treatment of this exciting new body of work and its applications, bridging the gap between theoretical and applied perspectives in the management of complex adaptive systems. Focusing primarily on natural resource management and community-based conservation, the book features contributions by leading scholars in the field, many of whom are among the leaders of the Resilience Alliance. Theoreticians will find a valuable synthesis of new ideas on resilience, sustainability, asymmetries, information processing, scaling, and networks. Managers and policymakers will benefit from the application of these ideas to practical approaches and empirical studies linked to social-ecological systems. Chapters present new twists on such existing approaches as scenario planning, scaling analyses, and adaptive management, and the book concludes with recommendations on how to manage natural resources, how to involve stakeholders in the dynamics of a system, and how to explain the difficult topic of scale. A vital reference for an emerging discipline, this volume provides a clearer understanding of the conditions required for systems self-organization, since the capacity of any system to self-organize is crucial for its sustainability over time.},

abstract = {Biodiversity plays a vital role for ecosystem functioning in a changing environment. Yet theoretical approaches that incorporate diversity into classical ecosystem theory do not provide a general dynamic theory based on mechanistic principles. In this paper, we suggest that approaches developed for quantitative genetics can be extended to ecosystem functioning by modeling the means and variances of phenotypes within a group of species. We present a framework that suggests that phenotypic variance within functional groups is linearly related to their ability to respond to environmental changes. As a result, the long-term productivity for a group of species with high phenotypic variance may be higher than for the best single species, even though high phenotypic variance decreases productivity in the short term, because suboptimal species are present. In addition, we find that in the case of accelerating environmental change, species succession in a changing environment may become discontinuous. Our work suggests that this phenomenon is related to diversity as well as to the environmental disturbance regime, both of which are affected by anthropogenic activities. By introducing new techniques for modeling the aggregate behavior of groups of species, the present approach may provide a new avenue for ecosystem analysis.},

abstract = {A review with refs. is given on geomicrobiol. interactions in caves, which are nutrient-limited environments contg. a variety of redox interfaces. Interactions of cave microorganisms and mineral environments lead to the dissoln. of, or pptn. on, host rock and speleothems (secondary mineral formations). Metabolic processes of sulfur-, iron-, and manganese-oxidizing bacteria can generate considerable acidity, dissolving cave walls and formations. Examples of possible microbially influenced corrosion include corrosion residues (e.g., Lechuguilla and Spider caves, New Mexico), moonmilk from a no. of caves (e.g., Spider Cave, New Mexico, and caves in the Italian Alps), and sulfuric acid speleogenesis and cave enlargement (e.g., Movile Cave, Romania, and Cueva de Villa Luz, Mexico). Pptn. processes in caves, as in surface environments, occur through active or passive processes. In caves, microbially induced mineralization is documented in the formation of carbonates, moonmilk, silicates, clays, iron and manganese oxides, sulfur, and saltpeter at scales ranging from the microscopic to landscape biokarst. Suggestions for future research are given to encourage a move from descriptive, qual. studies to more exptl. studies. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = {Understanding the genetic structure of human populations is of fundamental interest to medical, forensic and anthropological sciences. Advances in high-throughput genotyping technology have markedly improved our understanding of global patterns of human genetic variation and suggest the potential to use large samples to uncover variation among closely spaced populations. Here we characterize genetic variation in a sample of 3,000 European individuals genotyped at over half a million variable DNA sites in the human genome. Despite low average levels of genetic differentiation among Europeans, we find a close correspondence between genetic and geographic distances; indeed, a geographical map of Europe arises naturally as an efficient two-dimensional summary of genetic variation in Europeans. The results emphasize that when mapping the genetic basis of a disease phenotype, spurious associations can arise if genetic structure is not properly accounted for. In addition, the results are relevant to the prospects of genetic ancestry testing; an individual's DNA can be used to infer their geographic origin with surprising accuracy-often to within a few hundred kilometres.},

abstract = {Many potentially mutualistic interactions are conditional, with selection that varies between mutualism and antagonism over space and time. We develop a genetic model of temporally variable coevolution that incorporates stochastic fluctuations between mutualism and antagonism. We use this model to determine conditions necessary for the coevolution of matching traits between a host and a conditional mutualist. Using an analytical approximation, we show that matching traits will coevolve when the geometric mean interaction is mutualistic. When this condition does not hold, polymorphism and trait mismatching are maintained, and coevolutionary cycles may result. Numerical simulations verify this prediction and suggest that it remains robust in the presence of temporal autocorrelation. These results are compared with those from spatial models with unrestricted movement. The comparisons demonstrate that gene flow is unnecessary for generating empirical patterns predicted by the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution.},

@article{Nunney1988,
abstract = {W. D. Hamilton (1967, Science 156, 477-488) calculated the optimum sex-ratio strategy for a population subdivided into local mating groups. He made three important assumptions: that the females founding each group responded precisely to the number of them initiating the group; that ail broods within a group matured synchronously; and that males were incapable of dispersing between groups. We have examined the effects of relaxing each of these assumptions and obtained the following results: (1) When broods mature asynchronously the optimum sex ratio is considerably more female biased than the Hamiltonian prediction. (2) Increasing male dispersal always decreases the optimum female bias to the sex ratio, but it is of particular interest that when moderate levels of dispersal are coupled with asynchrony of brood maturation then the optimum strategy is relatively insensitive to changes in foundress number. (3) When females cannot precisely determine the number of other foundresses initiating the group then the optimum strategy is almost exactly the strategy appropriate to a group of average size. These effects can be most easily understood in terms of local parental control (LPC) of the sex ratio. Through LPC a founding female can alter the mating success of her sons by altering the sex ratio of her brood. Asynchrony in the maturation of broods within a group increases the control that a founding female has over the mating success of her sons, whereas male dispersal reduces it. We have shown that the role of LPC and the role of inbreeding, which favors a female-biased sex ratio in haploidiploid species, are independent and that their effects can be combined into a single general formula r = (1-(r2/z2) E(alpha z/alpha r]/(1 + I). The concept of LPC can also be used to interpret two factors which have been proposed to select for the Hamiltonian sex ratios: local mate competition is LPC acting through sons; and sib mating is LPC acting through daughters.},

abstract = {Many annual plant populations undergo dramatic fluctuations in size. Such fluctuations can result in the loss of genetic variability. Here I formalize the potential for a seed bank to buffer against such genetic loss. The average time to seed germination (T) defines the generation time of "annuals" with a seed bank, and assuming random seed germination, I show that, under otherwise ideal conditions, a population's effective size (Ne) equals NT, where N is the number of adult plants. This result supports the general principle that lengthening the prereproductive period increases Ne. When adult numbers vary, Ne at any time depends on N and on the numbers contributing to the seed bank in previous seasons. Averaging these effects over time gives Ne approximately Nh + (T - 1)Na, where Nh and Na are the harmonic and arithmetic means of the adult population. Thus if T {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1, Ne is determined primarily by Na. Simulations showed that until fluctuations in N are large ({\textgreater}25x) this relationship is accurate. I extended the theory to incorporate a selfing rate (S) and reproductive variance (I) through seed production (k), outcrossed pollen (m), and variation in selfing rate: Ne = NT(1 -S/2)/(1 + I) = NT/[1 + FIS)(1 + I)]. Reproductive variance (I) equals [Ik(1 + S)2 + IM(1 - S)2 + 2(1 - S2)Ikm = S2IS(1 + Ik)]/4, , where Ij is the standardized variance (Vj/j2) of factor j and Ikm is the standardized covariance between k and m. These results are applicable to other organisms with a similar life history, such as freshwater crustaceans with diapausing eggs (e.g., tadpole shrimp, clam shrimp, and fairy shrimp) and other semelparous species with discrete breeding seasons and a variable maturation time (e.g., Pacific salmon).},

Here, we test the prevalence and causes of nonequilibrium dynamics in metacommunities of mites associated with rubber trees distributed over large spatial ({\textgreater}1,000 km) and temporal ({\textgreater}30–60 generations) scales in Brazil. We measured colonization and extinction rates to test species turnover and nonequilibrium dynamics over a growing season. Mite metacommunities exhibited nonequilibrium dynamics for most months of the year, and these dynamics tracked climatic conditions. Monthly shifts in temperature of more than 1°C resulted in nonequilibrium dynamics, as did mean temperatures outside of two critical ranges. Nonequilibrium dynamics were caused by a change in colonization with temperature change and changes in b...},

These changes are reflected in the new phenotypic characteristics developed by biofilm bacteria and occur in response to a variety of en- vironmental signals. Recent genetic and molecular approaches used to study bacterial and fungal biofilms have identified genes and regulatory circuits important for initial cell-surface interactions, biofilm maturation, and the return of biofilm microorganisms to a planktonic mode of growth. Studies to date suggest that the planktonic-biofilm transition is a complex and highly regulated process.

abstract = {We studied zooplankton dynamics in a groundwater-fed, montane lake during four consecutive years and assessed the importance of water residence time for zooplankton dynamics. Crustacean abundance and biomass were significantly correlated with water residence time and temperature, but showed no significant correlation with phytoplankton biovolume. We hypothesised that temperature depended on water residence time (T), and therefore we further investigated the functional relationship of crustacean dominance with the latter by logistic regression analysis. Water residence time values above a threshold value (tau = 193 days) determined crustacean biomass dominance while values below determined rotiferan dominance. Our results indicated that water residence time was an important factor structuring zooplankton succession in this lake that showed large fluctuations Of T values (median 263 days; range 23-786 days for the four year period) compared to other lakes. We suggest that crustacean biomass was directly controlled through water residence time as found for riverine systems, whereas rotifer biomass was controlled through exploitative competition with crustaceans for phytoplankton. The importance of water residence time may have been underestimated in lakes when explaining zooplankton community structure and succession, because studies usually focus on other factors such as temperature, predation, or food limitation},

Moreover, through genome reconstruction (2.2-2.5 MB, coverage depth × 26-513) and functional potential characterization, we discover these Treponema are diverse, fall outside of pathogenic clades and are similar to Treponema succinifaciens, a known carbohydrate metabolizer in swine.

abstract = {Although predation has a lethal effect on prey, mature terrestrial plants are rarely killed by herbivores, but herbivory can change plant allelochemistry, cell structure and growth, physiology, morphology, and phenology. This review explores the herbivore-induced indirect effects mediated by such plant responses following her- bivory in terrestrial systems. Herbivore-induced indirect effects are ubiquitous in many plant–herbivore systems, and indirect interactions occur among temporally separated, spatially separated, and taxonomically distinct herbivore species. Unlike interspecific competition, herbivores can benefit each other through plant-mediated indirect ef- fects. Herbivore-induced changes in plants occur at low levels of herbivory, which in- creases the likelihood of plant-mediated indirect interactions between herbivores. The herbivore-induced indirect effects result in interaction linkages, which alter species richness and abundance in arthropod communities. Such interaction linkages should be depicted using indirect interaction webs, which incorporate nontrophic, indirect links. The idea of interaction linkages by herbivore-induced indirect effects that shape community organization and biodiversity is an important revision of the traditional view of plant-based terrestrial food webs.},

abstract = {Total inertia (TI), the sum of eigenvalues for all ordination axes, is often used as a measure of total variation in a data set. By use of simulated data sets, I demonstrate that lack-of-fit of data to the response model implicit in any eigenvector ordination method results in polynomial distortion ordination axes, with eigenvalues that normally contribute 30 - 70 {\%} to TI (depending on data set properties). The amount of compositional variation extracted on ecologically interpretable ordination axes (structure axes) is thus underestimated by the eigenvalue-to-total-inertia ratio. I recommend that the current use of total inertia as a measure of compositional variation is discontinued. Eigenvalues of structure axes can, however, be used with some caution to indicate their relative importance. I also demonstrate that when the total inertia is partitioned on different sets of explanatory variables and unexplained variation by use of (partial) constrained ordination, (35) 50 - 85 {\%} of the variation unexplained by the supplied explanatory variables represents lack-of-fit of data to model. Thus, the common interpretation of unexplained variation as random variation (noise) or coenoclinal variation caused by unmeasured explanatory variables, is generally inappropriate. I recommend a change of focus from the variationexplained- to-total inertia ratio and unexplained variation to relative amounts of variation explained by different sets of explanatory variables.},

abstract = {Hurlbert divides experimental ecologist into ‘those who do not see any need for dispersion (of replicated treatments and controls), and those who do recognize its importance and take whatever measures are necessary to achieve a good dose of it'. Experimental ecologists could also be divided into those who do not see any problems with sacrificing spatial and temporal scales in order to obtain replication, and those who understand that appropriate scale must always have priority over replication. If an experiment is conducted in a spatial or temporal scale, where the predictions of contesting hypotheses are convergent or ambiguous, no amount of technical impeccability can make the work instructive. Conversely, replication can always be obtained afterwards, by conducting more experiments with basically similar design in different areas and by using meta-analysis. This approach even reduces the sampling bias obtained if resources are allocated to a small number of well-replicated experiments. For a strict advocate of the hypothetico-deductive method, replication is unnecessary even as a matter of principle, unless the predicted response is so weak that random background noise is a plausible excuse for a discrepancy between predictions and results. By definition, a prediction is an ‘all- statement', referring to all systems within a well-defined category. What applies to all must apply to any. Hence, choosing two systems and assigning them randomly to a treatment and a control is normally an adequate design for a deductive experiment. The strength of such experiments depends on the firmness of the predictions and their a priori probability of corroboration. Replication is but one of many ways of reducing this probability. Whether the experiment is replicated or not, inferential statistics should always be used, to enable the reader to judge how well the apparent patterns in samples reflect real patterns in statistical populations. The concept ‘pseudoreplication' amounts to entirely unwarranted stigmatization of a reasonable way to test predictions referring to large-scale systems.},

abstract = {Based on the assumption that each trophic level acts as a single exploitative population, a model relating the trophic structure of ecosystems to their potential primary productivity is developed. According to the model, herbivory pressure should be most severe in relatively unproductive environments. With increased potential productivity, the role of predation in herbivore regulation should become more important and the impact of herbivory upon plant communities should decrease. In very productive environments, increase in herbivory pressure is again probable, at least in aquatic ecosystems. The predicted pattern of phytomass and predicted results of manipulations are compared with available data. A reasonable fit between predictions and observations is found, although the sparsity of data and methodological uncertainties weaken the corroboration in several cases. In terrestrial ecosystems, the present version of the model seems best applicable to the vertebrate branch of the grazing chain, whereas the arthropod branch may be more sensitive to temperature than to average annual productivity.},

abstract = {Microbial ecology has focused much on causes of between-site variation in community composition. By analysing five data-sets each of aquatic bacteria and phytoplankton, we demonstrated that microbial communities show a large degree of similarity in community composition and that abundant taxa were widespread, a typical pattern for many metazoan metacommunities. The regional abundance of taxa explained on average 85 and 41{\%} of variation in detection frequency and 58 and 31{\%} of variation in local abundances for bacteria and phytoplankton, respectively. However, regional abundance explained less variation in local abundances with increasing environmental variation between sites within data-sets. These findings indicate that the studies of microbial assemblages need to consider similarities between communities to better understand the processes underlying the assembly of microbial communities. Finally, we propose that the degree of regional invariance can be linked to the evolution of microbes and the variation in ecosystem functions performed by microbial communities.},

abstract = {Isolated habitats generally have fewer species at local spatial scales than more connected habitats. However, over larger spatial scales, the response of species richness to variation in the degree of isolation is variable. Here, we hypothesized that the effects of habitat isolation on patterns of regional level species richness may depend at least in part on the level of disturbances those habitats receive. We tested this hypothesis in a microcosm experiment using an aquatic community consisting of container dwelling protists and rotifers by manipulating disturbance and dispersal to experimental regions factorially. In disturbed regions, regional species richness was lower in regions with isolated patches compared to regions where patches were experimentally connected by dispersal. A likely mechanism for this result is that dispersal from adjacent undisturbed local patches allowed disturbance-intolerant species a temporary refugia, thereby allowing regional coexistence of disturbance-tolerant and intolerant species. In contrast, without disturbances (and thus no temporal heterogeneity) it is likely that dispersal homogenized communities, leading to overall lower richness with higher dispersal. Our results emphasize the importance of simultaneously considering multiple limiting factors, disturbance and dispersal in this case, as well as the spatial scale of the response, in order to fully understand factors that control biodiversity.},

abstract = {The properties of food webs are examined to assess whether the correct properties are being modelled. The linkage arrangements and the extent of their variability and responses to local environmental change are examined using two webs from observations at Cape Flattery, Washington State and Torch Bay, Alaska. It is concluded that enumerating links through direct observations provides little information on a particular species' importance and the connecting component of food webs is susceptible to enormous geographic and within habitat variations. What counts is the competitive stature of the preferred prey, implying that cross-links will be as important as trophic ones. The evidence for strong interactions and some of their consequences as a unit are discussed. Basic data are given on 3 experiments in the marine environment that reveal the difficulty of examining weak interactions. The author concludes that trophic links are unequal in strength, and most benthic and aquatic communities seem to be characterized by high variance in this measure. Strong links ar easily demonstrated experimentally and their presence readily explains the cascading changes that characterize certain altered ecosystems. Further, predictable strong linkage can generate trophically different but persistent alternative resource bases. These later appear not to develop when the strong interaction is unpredictable in space or time. Finally, predictable strong interactions can encourage the development of modules or subsystems embedded within the community nexus. The individuals comprising these may be co-adapted to one another and exhibit sophisticated mutualisms.},

abstract = {Many terrestrial and marine systems are open to immigration. As such, the delivery of reproductive propagules should play a substantial role in determining local diversity in many systems. Here we present the results of a two-year experimental manipulation of subtidal flow regimes and show that flow has a strong positive effect on the assembly and maintenance of epifaunal invertebrate diversity by reducing recruitment limitation in two biogeographic regions. At two sites each in Alaska and Maine, USA, we experimentally manipulated flow speeds and measured the diversity of communities assembling through time and on recruitment panels scraped clean regularly. At all sites, the species richness of established communities, and the richness of recruitment into established communities and onto empty plates was {\textgreater}25{\%} higher in enhanced flow than in control flow treatments.

abstract = {We present several models concerning the short term consequences of spreading offspring in varying environments. Our goal is to determine what patterns of spatial and temporal variation yield an advantage to increasing scale of dispersal. Of necessity, the models are somewhat artificial but we feel they are a reasonable approximation of and hence generalizable to natural systems. With these models we examine consequences of dispersal arising from environmental variation: increased en- vironmental variance, different degrees of spatial and temporal correlation, some arbitrary spatial patterns of favorability and finally some patterns derived from long-term, large-scale weather data collected along a contiguous stretch of coastline from south- ern Oregon to northern Washington (USA). We examine the costs and benefits of increasing scale of dispersal in both density dependent and density independent models. Several conclusions may be drawn from the results of these models. In the absence of any spatial or temporal order to favora- bility (where favorability is directly proportional to either fitness or carrying capacity) increasing scale of spread produces a higher rate of population increase. At larger scales, though, an asymp- tote of maximum relative advantage is approached, so each add- ed increment of spread has a smaller contribution to fitness. This asymptote is higher and the approach to it relatively slower with increasing environmental variance. For a given environmen- tal variance, increasing spatial correlation results in a slower approach to the same asymptote. In density independent models, increasing temporal correlation of fitness selects against in- creased dispersal if expected differences between sites are suffi- ciently great relative to variation within sites; but in this instance, density dependence yields a somewhat different result: dispersers have a refuge at sites of low carrying capacity or sites lacking non-dispersers. Finally, optimum intermediate scales of dispersal can occur where differences in expected fitness increase with increasing distance from the parental site, such as in a gradient, but where the environmental variation at a given site is fairly large relative to differences in expected fitness between adjacent sites. The foregoing results are extended for the following predic- tions. When greater longevity in a resistant phase of the life cycle reduces temporal variation in survival and fecundity, in- creased generation time should decrease the benefits of spreading offspring in an environment that would otherwise favor spread * Order of authorship alphabetical and by increasing age and height and could either increase or decrease the costs of spreading offspring in an environment selecting against spread. We specu- late that if large scale patterns of varying survival and fecundity are similar to the variation in the physical environment which we examined with weather data, there should be little or no short term advantage to large scale spread of offspring (on the order of 50 kilometers or more) because expected differences increase and seldom if ever decrease with increasing distance between sites. This suggests that feeding larvae of benthic invertebrates with their concomitant long planktonic period, receive little if any advantage from increased scale of dispersal, and consequently that the advantages to planktotrophy over lecithotrophy must lie in other life history aspects, such as the ability to produce a greater number of smaller eggs.},

Three dominant perspectives compete to influence the science and practice of river restoration. A strong focus on channel morphology has led to approaches that involve major earth-moving activities such as channel re-configuration with the unmet assumption that ecological recovery will follow. Functional perspectives of river restoration aim to regain the full suite of biogeochemical, ecological, and hydrogeomorphic processes that make up a healthy river and while there is well-accepted theory to support this, research on methods to implement and assess functional restoration projects is in its infancy. A plethora of new studies worldwide report trends in why and how rivers are being restored as well as the project outcomes.

abstract = {Increased experimentation is essential if we are to understand the biotically rich hy- porheic zone and how it influences processes in other parts of lotic systems. Unique challenges face experimenters because the hyporheic zone is both extremely complex hydrologically and relatively inaccessible and difficult to manipulate. I discuss five major obstacles that impede exper- imental progress in hyporheic research and I suggest corollary experiments or technical develop- ments that are critical to our future research agenda. The first obstacle is that a conceptualization of the hyporheic zone, in which there are clearly definable boundaries that apply across all streams, is unlikely because of significant variations in geology and hydrology between drainage basins. How this zone is delineated may depend on the experimental question and we should "exploit" cross-system differences to motivate experiments. Second, developing methods of obtaining deep streambed samples in an undisturbed fashion, from defined positions within the streambed, and evaluating the effect of our experimental intervention on the process under study requires serious effort. Third, evaluating the impact of bed movement on hyporheic processes and quantifying or controlling for this movement in experiments will require new or modified techniques. Fourth, developing methods for quantifying and experimentally manipulating subsurface flows should be an essential part of research to determine how these flows influence system and community-level processes. This will require adaptation of existing techniques for measuring subsurface flows, so that they are useable at a variety of spatial scales, and simulation of subsurface flows in artificial streams and in-stream chambers. Fifth, the nature and extent to which a hyporheic component or ecological process is influenced by surface vs. groundwater inputs must be quantified. This will require the ability to separate surface from groundwater effects by means of experimental manip- ulation or design.},

abstract = {Recent work has shown that benthic invertebrate assemblages may be influenced in an ongoing fashion by dispersal. Water-column movements of meiofauna, juvenile insects and marine postlarvae are common and can act to alter greatly local dynamics such as predator-prey and competitive interactions in marine and stream ecosystems. These findings are important because past research on the role of dispersal in invertebrate dynamics has focused almost exclusively on how planktonic larval supply influences the establishment and maintenance of local assemblages, on the colonization of newly opened sites, or on the settlement success of new recruits. The emerging framework is that dispersal needs to be viewed as a regional process that may routinely influence local benthic dynamics, because fauna can move to and from water-column dispersal 'pools' and may do so at frequent intervals.},

abstract = {Variability in the spatial and temporal patterns of stream biota has been well documented, yet the causes and consequences of this variability are poorly understood. Most early work focused on how changes in mean environmental parameters over space or time influence the abundance or distribution patterns of biota. We argue for an increased focus on the study of variability in these parameters. To date, only a few lotic studies have used variance as a dependent variable i.e., showing that changes in the variance in some parameter can be related to changes in the mean of that or another parameter. These studies have suggested interesting links between ecological patterns and processes at a variety of scales. The use of variance as an independent variable and its experimental manipulation (i.e., hold the mean of some parameter constant while altering its variance) may also lead to new understandings of how pattern and process are linked. We begin by outlining when and why the study of variance may be important to lotic ecology. Next, we suggest a 3-step process in the use of variance in stream studies: 1) documentation of a pattern with respect to variance; 2) examination of descriptive data to explore potential causes of the pattern; and 3) direct manipulation of variance in experiments. We provide an example of this 3-step process using data from preliminary experiments in it warmwater stream that suggested spatial variability in the abundance of chironomids and copepods could be related to flow variability We close by suggesting that future directions for the use of variance in stream ecology should attempt to couple scale-dependent physical patterns with biological patterns or processes, develop experimental frameworks to determine if species interactions or other biotic processes vary with scale, embrace statistical methods for determining the relative importance of variance-generating processes, develop methods for the quantification of variance in biologically meaningful ways, and focus on the identification and interpretation of domains of homogeneous variance in streams.},

abstract = {The availability and spatial arrangement of habitat patches are known to strongly influence fauna in terrestrial ecosystems. The importance of patch arrangement is not well-studied within running-water systems where flow-induced movements of patches and of fauna could decouple habitat characteristics and faunal habitat preferences. Using small, stream-dwelling invertebrates, we asked if fauna in such systems can distinguish among patch types and if patch arrangement at their `landscape scale' (i.e., within a streambed across which they move and forage) can be linked to faunal abundance. We quantified the spatial distribution of sand and leaf patches at multiple sites on a streambed at regular intervals over a 1 1/2 yr period, estimated faunal abundance in the two patch types, and experimentally determined if faunal colonization varied among leaf patches that were similar structurally but differed in their potential microbial food resources. We show that despite their small size and limited swimming abilities, these stream invertebrates did respond to patch type, that specific characteristics of an individual patch influenced faunal colonization, and that the spatial arrangement of patches on the streambed was linked to field abundances. Larval chironomids and adult copepods were more abundant in leaves than in sand and preferentially colonized leaf patches made with rapidly decomposing leaves that harbored higher microbial (bacteria and fungi) abundances over leaf patches with more refractory leaves and lower microbial abundances. Further, statistical models that included spatially-explicit data on patch arrangement (e.g., patch contagion, distance between patches) explained significantly more variation in faunal abundance, than models that included only nonspatial information (e.g., date, time since last flood). Despite the fact that these fauna live in a highly dynamic environment with variable flow rates during the year, unstable patch configurations, and seasonal changes in total abundance, our findings suggest a need for aquatic ecologists to test the hypothesis that small-scale landscape attributes within streams (e.g., leaf patch aggregation) may be important to faunal dynamics. If patch aggregation has negative consequences for stream biota, streambed `landscapes' may be fundamentally different from many terrestrial landscapes due to the inherent connectivity provided by the water and the over-riding importance of patch edges. Regardless of these differences, our findings suggest that the spatial configuration of patches in a landscape may have consequences for fauna even in highly dynamic systems, in which patches move and fauna periodically experience high levels of passive dispersal.},

Then, in a com- mon gardening experiment, we compared zooplankton community composition when either experimentally adapted or D. magna from the original population were present. Local adaptation of D. magna significantly altered zooplankton community composition, leading to a suppression of abundances for some zooplankton taxa and facilitation for others. The effect size of D. magna adap- tation was similar to that of adding fish or macrophytes to mesocosms, two important drivers of zooplankton community structure. Our results suggest that substantial amounts of variation in com- munity composition in natural systems may be unexplained if evolutionary dynamics are ignored.},

The presence or absence of 21 selected exotic plant species and light levels were observed along 0.3- to 1.0-km transects within four habitat types. Each habitat represented a different level of disturbance: high-use roads, low-use roads, abandoned roads, and streams in the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest. Nearly 300 50  2–m sampling units were surveyed along five transects in each habitat type. We used ordination (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) and logistic regression to analyze data. All of the nearly 200 sampling units along roads with high and low levels of vehicle traffic contained at least one exotic plant species, and some con- tained as many as 14. Streams that were most recently disturbed by floods 20–30 years ago and abandoned spur roads with no traffic for 20–40 years also had numerous exotic species. Roads and streams apparently serve multiple functions that enhance exotic species invasion in this landscape: they act as corridors or agents for dispersal, provide suitable habitat, and contain reservoirs of propagules for future episodes of in- vasion. Species-specific dispersal mechanisms, habitat characteristics, and disturbance history each explain some, but not all, of the patterns of exotic species invasion observed in this study.},

abstract = {Abstract Ecological changes in the phenology and distribution of plants and animals are occurring in all well-studied marine, freshwater, and terrestrial groups. These observed changes are heavily biased in the directions predicted from global warming and have been linked to local or regional climate change through correlations between climate and biological variation, field and laboratory experiments, and physiological research. Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountaintop species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level.},

abstract = {There is increasing pressure from policymakers for ecologists to generate more detailed 'attribution' analyses aimed at quantitatively estimating relative contributions of different driving forces, including anthropogenic climate change (ACC), to observed biological changes. Here, we argue that this approach is not productive for ecological studies. Global meta-analyses of diverse species, regions and ecosystems have already given us 'very high confidence' [sensu Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)] that ACC has impacted wild species in a general sense. Further, for well-studied species or systems, synthesis of experiments and models with long-term observations has given us similarly high confidence that they have been impacted by regional climate change (regardless of its cause). However, the role of greenhouse gases in driving these impacts has not been estimated quantitatively. Should this be an ecological research priority? We argue that development of quantitative ecological models for this purpose faces several impediments, particularly the existence of strong, non-additive interactions among different external factors. However, even with current understanding of impacts of global warming, there are myriad climate change adaptation options already developed in the literature that could be, and in fact are being, implemented now.},

abstract = {In the past decade, significant debate has surrounded the relative contributions of genetic determinants versus environmental conditions to certain types of human behavior. While this debate goes on, it is with a certain degree of irony that microbiologists studying aspects of bacterial community behavior face the same questions. Information regarding two social phenomena exhibited by bacteria, quorum sensing and biofilm development, is reviewed here. These two topics have been inextricably linked, possibly because biofilms and quorum sensing represent two areas in which microbiologists focus on social aspects of bacteria. We will examine what is known about this linkage and discuss areas that might be developed. In addition, we believe that these two aspects of bacterial behavior represent a small part of the social repertoire of bacteria. Bacteria exhibit many social activities and they represent a model for dissecting social behavior at the genetic level. Therefore, we introduce the term 'sociomicrobiology'.},

It has been previously shown that weak diffusion along an environmental gradient can drive an otherwise periodic predator-prey model into quasiperiodicity and chaos. The model is a reaction-diffusion equation with a Type II functional response of the predator and a logistic growth of the prey. The intrinsic growth rate of the prey varies linearly in space. We compare the spatial patterns of the populations to the underlying gradient. The spatial patterns of the predator and prey can differ strongly from the underlying environmental gradient. As diffusion becomes weaker, and the system moves from limit cycles through quasiperiodicity to chaos, this difference is magnified and the population patterns display smaller spatial scales.},

abstract = {Predator-prey and other nonlinear ecological interactions often lead to oscillatory dynamics in temporal systems and in spatial systems when the rates of movement are large, so that individuals are effectively well mixed and space becomes unimportant. When individuals are not well mixed, however. properties of fluctuations in population densities, and in particular their amplitudes. are known to vary with the spatial scale at which the system is observed. We investigate the relationship among dynamics at different spatial scales with an individual-based predator-prey model that is stochastic and nonlinear. Results elucidate the role of spatial pattern and individual variability in the dynamics of densities. We show that spatial patterns in this system reduce the per capita rates of predation and prey growth but preserve functional forms. The functional forms remain those one would expect in a well-mixed system in which individuals interact according to mean population densities, but with modified parameters. This similarity of the functional forms allows us to approximate accurately the long-term dynamics of the spatial system at large scales with a temporal predator-prey model with only two variables, a simple system of ordinary differential equations of the type ecologists have been using for a long time. This approximation provides an explanation for the stabilizing role of space. the decrease in the amplitude of fluctuations from the well-mixed to the limited-movement case. We also provide an explanation for the previously described aperiodic dynamics of densities at intermediate spatial scales. These irregular cycles result from the interplay of demographic noise with decaying oscillations, where the decay of the cycles is due to the spatial patterns. It is indeed possible to capture essential properties of these cycles. including their apparent sensitivity to initial conditions, with a model that follows individuals but parameterizes their spatial interactions in a simple way, using again the similarity of functional forms and the modified parameters. Thus, demographic noise appears essential at a spatial scale previously chosen for the high degree of determinism in the dynamics. Our results illustrate a semi-empirical approach to simplify and to scale spatial ecological systems that are oscillatory from individual or local-scale to large-scale dynamics.},

Using this framework and continental data on stream environment, diatoms, invertebrates and fish, I address the following fundamental, but unresolved ecological questions: how do species partition their resources across environments, is energetic equivalence among them possible, are generalists more common than specialists, why are locally abundant species also regionally prevalent, and, do microbes have different biogeography than macroorganisms? The discovery that community scaling behaviour is environmentally constrained calls for better integration of macroecology and environmental science.},

abstract = {The nested subset hypothesis was formulated to describe and explain patterns in the community structure of insular mammal faunas which are in the state of ‘relaxation'. The hypothesis states that the species comprising a depauperate fauna should constitute a proper subset of those in richer faunas, and that an archipelago of such faunas arranged by species richness should present a nested series. The non-randomness of this pattern is evaluated for montane mammals in the American Southwest using Monte Carlo simulations under two sets of conditions. First, we constructed model archipelagos with the observed distribution of species richnesses, drawing individual species at random (without replacement) from the species pool (RANDOM0). Secondly, we constructed model archipelagos having the observed distribution of species richnesses, but weighted the selection of species by their actual frequencies of occurrence (RANDOM1). The degree of nestedness in the model archipelagos was then used to assess the non-randomness of the observed structure. Actual Southwestern mammal faunas have a far more nested structure than model archipelagos produced by either RANDOM0 or RANDOM1, and there is virtually zero probability that observed structure is represented in the distribution of scores from either simulation run. Similar analyses were conducted on other archipelagos to determine the generality of this relationship and to identify variables putatively responsible for its production. Mammal faunas of large islands off the coast of Maine, U.S.A., studied by Crowell (1986) also comprise nested subsets, as do those inhabiting islands off the coast of Baja California, Mexico, studied by Lawlor (1983). Significantly, when the Baja archipelago is divided into landbridge islands (which are presumed to be relaxing to lower species level) and oceanic islands (where species number is limited by successful overwater dispersal), only the former show significant nestedness under the more stringent conditions of RANDOM1. These results and theoretical considerations suggest that selective extinction of species may be chiefly responsible for the nestedness in natural archipelagos. Our conclusions have obvious implications for the design of natural preserves (e.g. SLOSS): several small fragments of a single biota can be expected to support nested subsets of the species originally present or that would likely be retained in a single large preserve. Even more sobering are arguments raised which suggest that the faunas of preserves established in different habitats within the same biome might be expected to converge in composition via selective extinction.},

In addition to imperviousness, runoff from urbanized surfaces as well as municipal and in- dustlial discharges result in increased loading of nutrients, metals, pesticides, and other contaminants to streams.

We found that, while many traits were determined both by phylogeny and environment, trait convergence within the phylogeny was extensive and eroded the phylogenetic structure associated with habitat use.

abstract = {Predator effects on prey dynamics are conventionally studied by measuring changes in prey abundance attributed to consumption by predators. We revisit four classic examples of predator-prey systems often cited in textbooks and incorporate subsequent studies of nonconsumptive effects of predators (NCE), defined as changes in prey traits (e.g., behavior, growth, development) measured on an ecological time scale. Our review revealed that NCE were integral to explaining lynx-hare population dynamics in boreal forests, cascading effects of top predators in Wisconsin lakes, and cascading effects of killer whales and sea otters on kelp forests in nearshore marine habitats. The relative roles of consumption and NCE of wolves on moose and consequent indirect effects on plant communities of Isle Royale depended on climate oscillations. Nonconsumptive effects have not been explicitly tested to explain the link between planktonic alewives and the size structure of the zooplankton, nor have they been invoked to attribute keystone predator status in intertidal communities or elsewhere. We argue that both consumption and intimidation contribute to the total effects of keystone predators, and that characteristics of keystone consumers may differ from those of predators having predominantly NCE. Nonconsumptive effects are often considered as an afterthought to explain observations inconsistent with consumption-based theory. Consequently, NCE with the same sign as consumptive effects may be overlooked, even though they can affect the magnitude, rate, or scale of a prey response to predation and can have important management or conservation implications. Nonconsumptive effects may underlie other classic paradigms in ecology, such as delayed density dependence and predator-mediated prey coexistence. Revisiting classic studies enriches our understanding of predator-prey dynamics and provides compelling rationale for ramping up efforts to consider how NCE affect traditional predator-prey models based on consumption, and to compare the relative magnitude of consumptive and NCE of predators.},

abstract = {Establishing relationships between species distributions and environmental characteristics is a major goal in the search for forces driving species distributions. Canonical ordinations such as redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis are invaluable tools for modeling communities through environmental predictors. They provide the means for conducting direct explanatory analysis in which the association among species can be studied according to their common and unique relationships with the environmental variables and other sets of predictors of interest, such as spatial variables. Variation partitioning can then be used to test and determine the likelihood of these sets of predictors in explaining patterns in community structure. Although variation partitioning in canonical analysis is routinely used in ecological analysis, no effort has been reported in the literature to consider appropriate estimators so that comparisons between fractions or, eventually, between different canonical models are meaningful. In this paper, we show that variation partitioning as currently applied in canonical analysis is biased. We present appropriate unbiased estimators. In addition, we outline a statistical test to compare fractions in canonical analysis. The question addressed by the test is whether two fractions of variation are significantly different from each other. Such assessment provides an important step toward attaining an understanding of the factors patterning community structure. The test is shown to have correct Type I. error rates and good power for both redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis.},

abstract = {Patterns in biodiversity and species coexistence are the result of multiple interacting processes including evolutionary history, trait variation, species interactions, dispersal, environmental variation, and landscape heterogeneity. Exploring patterns of biodiversity across space is perhaps the best integrative method (in contrast to the scarcity of temporal data) to interpret the influence of these multiple and interactive effects in determining community assembly, but it is still underdeveloped. Two emerging fields, metacommunity ecology and community phylogenetics, have been making relevant, though rather independent, progress toward understanding how communities are assembled in space. Our main goals were twofold. First, we described a heuristical framework to merge these two fields into ‘‘metacommunity phylogenetics.'' The main goal of this framework is to provide a way to think about how niche properties of species arranged across the environment and different spatial scales influence the process of community assembly. Second, we developed an analytical frameworktolinkniche properties basedontrait andphylogenetics to environmental and spatial variation. In order to assess the performance of the framework, we used extensive computer simulations of community assembly to show that the procedure is robust under a variety of scenarios.},

abstract = {Effects of fragmentation on the ecology of organisms occupying dendritic ecological networks (DENs) have recently been described through both conceptual and mathematical models, but few hypotheses have been tested in complex, real-world ecosystems. Stream fishes provide a model system for assessing effects of fragmentation on the structure of communities occurring within DENs, including how fragmentation alters metacommunity dynamics and biodiversity. A recently developed habitat-availability measure, the "dendritic connectivity index'' (DCI), allows for assigning quantitative measures of connectivity in DENs regardless of network extent or complexity, and might be used to predict fish community response to fragmentation. We characterized stream fish community structure in 12 DENs in the Great Plains, USA, during periods of dynamic (summer) and muted (fall) discharge regimes to test the DCI as a predictive model of fish community response to fragmentation imposed by road crossings. Results indicated that fish communities in stream segments isolated by road crossings had reduced species richness (alpha diversity) relative to communities that maintained connectivity with the surrounding DEN during summer and fall. Furthermore, isolated communities had greater dissimilarity (beta diversity) to downstream sites not isolated by road crossings during summer and fall. Finally, dissimilarity among communities within DENs decreased as a function of increased habitat connectivity (measured using the DCI) for summer and fall, suggesting that communities within highly connected DENs tend to be more homogeneous. Our results indicate that the DCI is sensitive to community effects of fragmentation in riverscapes and might be used by managers to predict ecological responses to changes in habitat connectivity. Moreover, our findings illustrate that relating structural connectivity of riverscapes to functional connectivity among communities might aid in maintaining metacommunity dynamics and biodiversity in complex dendritic ecosystems.},

abstract = {The oxic realms of freshwater and marine environments are zones of high prokaryotic mortality. Lysis by viruses and predation by ciliated and flagellated protists result in the consumption of microbial biomass at approximately the same rate as it is produced. Protist predation can favour or suppress particular bacterial species, and the successful microbial groups in the water column are those that survive this selective grazing pressure. In turn, aquatic bacteria have developed various antipredator strategies that range from simply 'outrunning' protists to the production of highly effective cytotoxins. This ancient predator-prey system can be regarded as an evolutionary precursor of many other interactions between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.},

abstract = {1 A metapopulation neighbourhood model of an annual plant species in a harsh environment is derived. It includes the effects of seed survival, dormancy, competition, dispersal, spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and stochastic local extinctions. 2 The model contained the following assumptions: (i) the time step is 1 year; (ii) competition is density-dependent via a Hassell-type submodel; (iii) each local population is regulated separately within a hexagonal cell, 1 m across, and the cells form a tessellated array; (iv) dispersal is from a parent cell to its neighbours and declines exponentially with distance; (v) the harshness of the environment is a value set for each cell; spatial and temporal heterogeneity are introduced by altering this value; (vi) each local population is rounded to give an integer number of individuals at the end of each generation so that those with density below unity may become extinct, with a probability inversely proportional to density. 3 In spatially homogeneous and heterogeneous harsh environments with moderate levels of density-dependent competition, all populations persisted and dispersal aided metapopulation growth when the population growth rate was sufficiently large. When the population growth rate was smaller, dispersal increased the risk of, and speeded up the time to, metapopulation extinction. Metapopulation growth was faster when the heterogeneity was at a larger-scale spatial pattern. 4 Temporal heterogeneity had an adverse effect when added to the existing spatial heterogeneity; strongly dispersing metapopulations were affected only slightly, while those with only moderate or no dispersal became extinct. The more frequently the environment changed, the greater was the probability of extinction. 5 The model simulations in 2--4 were repeated for more-severe density-dependence. In the spatially homogeneous environment dispersal prevented metapopulation extinction, while lack of dispersal encouraged it. Dispersal aided metapopulation growth in the spatially heterogeneous unchanging environment. The addition of temporal heterogeneity had little effect on populations with strong dispersal but the effect on the other metapopulations was catastrophic.},

abstract = {Forecasts of ecological dynamics in changing environments are increasingly important, and are available for a plethora of variables, such as species abundance and distribution, community structure and ecosystem processes. There is, however, a general absence of knowledge about how far into the future, or other dimensions (space, temperature, phylogenetic distance), useful ecologi-cal forecasts can be made, and about how features of ecological systems relate to these distances. The ecological forecast horizon is the dimensional distance for which useful forecasts can be made. Five case studies illustrate the influence of various sources of uncertainty (e.g. parameter uncertainty, environmental variation, demographic stochasticity and evolution), level of ecological organisation (e.g. population or community), and organismal properties (e.g. body size or number of trophic links) on temporal, spatial and phylogenetic forecast horizons. Insights from these case studies demonstrate that the ecological forecast horizon is a flexible and powerful tool for researching and communicating ecological predictability. It also has potential for motivating and guiding agenda setting for ecological forecasting research and development.},

abstract = {Enclosed experimental ecosystems (mesocosms) are small relative to their natural counterparts, are typically operated for short durations relative to the timescales of a number of important ecological processes, and also often have reduced biological and physical complexity relative to nature. These reductions in time, space, and complexity scales have been cited as sources of unrealistic ecological behavior within mesocosms and raise questions about extrapolating results from mesocosms to nature. Dimensional analysis, a technique widely used by engineers to create scale models, uses compensatory distortion as a means of maintaining dynamic similarity in properties and relationships of interest. Although biological parameters are generally less controllable than physical ones, a variety of dimensional approaches can be taken to maintain such key ecological properties as effective habitat size, environmental variability, vertical and horizontal gradients, interactions among habitats, and control of experimental artifacts. To date, application of dimensional approaches to mesocosm design has been largely intuitive and idiosyncratic. We argue that a more explicit, systematic, and quantitative approach will increase realism and may also provide a critical means of developing, testing, and advancing our understanding of scaling relationships in nature.},

The only standard method sufficiently sensitive to measure such low rates of carbon uptake is the radiocarbon (14C-C02) tracer method first introduced by Steemann Nielsen in 1952. This method has proven so useful that nearly all aquatic ecology laboratories now include it among their standard techniques. However, too few of us who use the method are fully aware of either the vast literature on the 14C method or the implications of this literature for our work. Over the past decade I have used the method extensively and have compared the results with other measures of the carbon budget of natural plankton assemblages. I frequently discovered that different methods did not agree and that the literature was a source of contradiction.},

Nitrate was also removed from stream water but traveled a distance 5 to 10 times as long, on average, as ammonium. Despite low ammonium concentration in stream water, nitrification rates were high, indicating that small streams are potentially important sources of atmospheric nitrous oxide.

abstract = {Characterization of sediment phosphorus is commonly based on sequential chemical extractions, in which phosphorus is supposed to be selectively removed from different compounds in the sediments. The first extraction schemes were designed to quantify discrete chemical or mineralogical compounds. As extraction schemes have been tested on different sediments, several systematic errors have been detected and the schemes have been modified and simplified accordingly. Other chemical extractions or treatments have attempted to determine phosphorus bound to particles with a certain strength or binding energy, the purpose being to determine the labile, loosely bound, exchangeable, mobile or algal-available fraction of sediment phosphorus. All extraction procedures yield operationally defined fractions and cannot be used for identification of discrete phosphorus compounds. The many methodological modifications make it necessary to be cautious when comparing results from the literature in this field.},

abstract = {A commercially available flow cytometer (Cytofluorograf) was used for the immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of spores of Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus subtilis, using fluorescein-labelled antispore conjugates. The cytometer was modified to allow analysis of known numbers of bacteria. In attempting to identify the region of the cytometer fluorescence histogram associated with the presence of stained spores, evidence was produced for signal components due to antibody bound to extracellular antigens. Under some reaction conditions these components were large enough partially or completely to obscure the fluorescence distribution imputed to the spores. The results support the hypothesis that the fluorescence histogram for a bacterial suspension can be modified by subtracting the histogram of the cell-free centrifugation supernatant to provide a fluorescence distribution more representative of the bacteria themselves. Spore and vegetative forms of B. anthracis could be differentiated in the flow IF assay by comparing the peak and area (integral) values of the photomultiplier output. The 90 degrees scatter histograms of the stained spores and their cell-free supernatants were so alike in shape that it was not possible to ascribe a unique peak to the spores themselves. Overall, these results confirm the considerable potential of flow cytometry for the rapid and quantitative IF assay of bacterial populations.},

abstract = {Understanding the context dependence of ecosystem responses to global changes requires the development of new conceptual frameworks. Here we propose a framework for considering how tree species and their mycorrhizal associates differentially couple carbon (C) and nutrient cycles in temperate forests. Given that tree species predominantly associate with a single type of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi), and that the two types of fungi differ in their modes of nutrient acquisition, we hypothesize that the abundance of AM and ECM trees in a plot, stand, or region may provide an integrated index of biogeochemical transformations relevant to C cycling and nutrient retention. First, we describe how forest plots dominated by AM tree species have nutrient economies that differ in their C-nutrient couplings from those in plots dominated by ECM trees. Secondly, we demonstrate how the relative abundance of AM and ECM trees can be used to estimate nutrient dynamics across the landscape. Finally, we describe how our framework can be used to generate testable hypotheses about forest responses to global change factors, and how these dynamics can be used to develop better representations of plant-soil feedbacks and nutrient constraints on productivity in ecosystem and earth system models.},

abstract = {The degree to which rising atmospheric CO(2) will be offset by carbon (C) sequestration in forests depends in part on the capacity of trees and soil microbes to make physiological adjustments that can alleviate resource limitation. Here, we show for the first time that mature trees exposed to CO(2) enrichment increase the release of soluble C from roots to soil, and that such increases are coupled to the accelerated turnover of nitrogen (N) pools in the rhizosphere. Over the course of 3 years, we measured in situ rates of root exudation from 420 intact loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) roots. Trees fumigated with elevated CO(2) (200 p.p.m.v. over background) increased exudation rates ($\mu$g C cm(-1) root h(-1) ) by 55{\%} during the primary growing season, leading to a 50{\%} annual increase in dissolved organic inputs to fumigated forest soils. These increases in root-derived C were positively correlated with microbial release of extracellular enzymes involved in breakdown of organic N (R(2) = 0.66; P = 0.006) in the rhizosphere, indicating that exudation stimulated microbial activity and accelerated the rate of soil organic matter (SOM) turnover. In support of this conclusion, trees exposed to both elevated CO(2) and N fertilization did not increase exudation rates and had reduced enzyme activities in the rhizosphere. Collectively, our results provide field-based empirical support suggesting that sustained growth responses of forests to elevated CO(2) in low fertility soils are maintained by enhanced rates of microbial activity and N cycling fuelled by inputs of root-derived C. To the extent that increases in exudation also stimulate SOM decomposition, such changes may prevent soil C accumulation in forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {Current theory predicts a distinct upper limit on the permissible degree of niche overlap; moreover, theory suggests that maximal tolerable overlap should be relatively insensitive to environmental variability. Data presented here demonstrate that, within the lizard subset of natural desert communities, niche overlap decreases both with increasing environmental variability and with increasing numbers of lizard species. The latter two factors are themselves positively correlated. A partial correlation analysis is interpreted as indicating that the extent of tolerable niche overlap does not necessarily decrease due to environmental variability, but rather that overlap is probably more closely related to the number of potential interspecific competitors in a community, or what has been termed "diffuse competition." This result lends support to the "niche overlap hypothesis," which asserts that maximal tolerable overlap should vary inversely with the intensity of competition. Moreover, this empirical discovery indicates that niche overlap theory could be profitably expanded to incorporate the number of competing species. Although the average amount of overlap between pairs of species decreases with the intensity of diffuse competition, the overall degree of competitive inhibition tolerated by individuals comprising an average species could nevertheless remain relatively constant, provided that extensive niche overlap with a few competitors is roughly equivalent to lower average overlap with a greater number of competitors.},

abstract = {Urban ecological studies, including focus on cities, suburbs, and exurbs, while having deep roots in the early to mid 20th century, have burgeoned in the last several decades. We use the state factor approach to highlight the role of important aspects of climate, substrate, organisms, relief, and time in differentiating urban from non-urban areas, and for determining heterogeneity within spatially extensive metropolitan areas. In addition to reviewing key findings relevant to each state factor, we note the emergence of tentative " urban syndromes" concerning soils, streams, wildlife and plants, and homogenization of certain ecosystem functions, such as soil organic carbon dynamics. We note the utility of the ecosystem approach, the human ecosystem framework, and watersheds as integrative tools to tie information about multiple state factors together. The organismal component of urban complexes includes the social organization of the human population, and we review key modes by which human populations within urban areas are differentiated, and how such differentiation affects environmentally relevant actions. Emerging syntheses in land change science and ecological urban design are also summarized. The multifaceted frameworks and the growing urban knowledge base do however identify some pressing research needs. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The question is how to add humans to the ecological models used to understand urban ecosystems. The ecosystem concept can serve as the basis, but specific social attributes of humans and their institutions must be added. Learning and feedback between the human and natural components of urban ecosystems are key attributes of the integrated model. Parallels with familiar ecological approaches can help in understanding the ecology of urban ecosystems. These include the role of spatial heterogeneity and organizational hierarchies in both the social and natural components of urban ecosystems. Although urban watersheds are commonly highly altered, the watershed approach can serve as a spatial basis for organizing comparative studies of ecosystems exhibiting differing degrees of urbanization. The watershed concept can also spatially organize the hierarchically scaled linkages by which the integrated human ecosystem model can be applied. The study of urban ecosystems is a relatively new field, and the questions suggested by the integrated framework can be used to frame ecosystem research in and associated with urban and metropolitan areas.},

In a herbivore-plant system, animal density influences selective pressure on plants; this selection influences genetic make-up of plant; and in turn, the genetic make-up of plant influences animal density. The actions and reactions of interacting populations in the food chain cycling in the genetic feed-back mechanism result in the evolution and regulation of animal populations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n},

Questions about the 'shape' of the food webs within which these species are embedded are much more rarely asked2−4. For example, what happens when a population feeds at more than one trophic level (omnivory)? In some real food webs there seem to be no omnivores (Fig. 1a)5; in others omnivores are common6,7 (Fig. 1c)8. In this note we attack the problem of omnivory using simple, linear Lotka−Volterra models of food webs9, and show that certain patterns are much more likely to persist on an evolutionary time scale than others. We then compare the model predictions with real food webs.},

abstract = {Well-known theoretical predictions are that the risk of extinction should decrease with maximum population size (K) and should increase with the temporal coefficient of variation in population size (CV). In an unvarying environment, where extinction is caused solely by demographic accidents, the risk of extinction should decrease steeply with K; the greater the contribution of environmental variability to the risk of extinction, the less steep should be the dependence on K. Large-bodied species tend to have long lifetimes but low rates of increase, which have opposite effects on the risk of extinction per year. We show that in comparisons of a large- and small-bodied species at the same average population size (N), the large-bodied species should be at less risk at low N but at greater risk at high N. We test these predictions using a data base of short-term survivals (up to a few decades) of 355 populations belonging to 100 species of British land birds on 16 islands. The mean N and risk of extinction are known for these populations, and we can calculate CV's for 39 of the species. To identify how factors other than N affect the risk of extinction, we devise a means of correcting that risk for much of the effect of N. We make the following observations. (1) Risk of extinction does decrease sharply with N. (2) After correcting for much of the effect of N, we confirm the theoretical prediction that the relative susceptibility to extinction of large- and small-bodied species reverses with increasing population size. Above seven pairs, larger-bodied species are at greater risk than smaller-bodied species; the reverse is true below seven pairs. (3) Migratory species are at greater risk of extinction than resident species. (4) Finally, after accounting for the effects of N, body size, and migratory status, we show that the risk of extinction does increase with the CV.},

While the criticisms may be muted and focus on his work, they cast doubt on all papers analyzing previously published food web data in many of our papers. The criticisms are telling because they are thoughtful and because Paine has written for so long and so effectively about food webs. Do Paine's commentsindicate serious flaws in our studies of food web? We feel the answer is yes: that analyses of previously published food webs have many limitations. However, neither of us has published a primary paper analyzing existing food web data since Pimm (1980a). What we have attempted to do since then is to adress many of the issues Paine has raised. What we shall attempt here is, first, the placement of syudies of existing food web data into a historical perspective. Then we shall review subsequent work, using both data collected expressly to test food web theories and experiments. Where we disagree with Paine is in our assessment of the health of food web research. Like the argument over whether a glass is half empty or half full, we agree with Paine's observations, but draw from them much more optimist conclusions.},

The state space of the two species' densities is partitioned into regions where the species take either their preferred habitat (assumed in this paper to be different), or both habitats. The functions partitioning the regions are called isolegs. Also superimposed upon the state space are the familiar isoclines, whose intersection gives the equilibrium densities for both species. The slopes of the isoclines are different in the different regions of the state space. Isoclines and isolegs are functionally dependent. We can derive conditions under which both species coexist using mutually exclusive habitats, and where, as a consequence, the isoclines intersect perpendicularly. These conditions appear to be easy to obtain ecologically, and are likely to be encountered when each species inhibits its competitor strongly in its (the species') preferred habitat.},

abstract = {Current evidence supports that dormant eggs of many zooplankton species from inland waters can be transported by wind. However, little is known about variation in wind dispersal propensity among different species and propagule types. Here, we experimentally investigate the wind speed required to pick-up propa- gules of a wide range of freshwater zooplankton species on different substrates. Counter-intuitively, larger propagules were consistently picked-up at lower wind speeds than smaller propagules. Grain size of the sub- strate affected adhesion because propagules were more easily picked-up from fine grained than from coarse grained or smooth surfaces. Overall, these results suggest that propagule morphology affects wind dispersal propensity and propagule bank erosion, providing a possible explanation for the large interspecific and intra- specific variation in propagule size and shape observed in nature. Ultimately, a better understanding of the link between propagule morphology, habitat structure, and dispersal propensity will be useful to understand diversity patterns and temporal dynamics in lentic aquatic habitats. It could also help to predict range expan- sion of freshwater zooplankton species, many of which are invasive outside of their natural ranges.},

Here, we show in a whole-island field experiment that without seaweed two predators—lizards and ants—had a substantially greater-than-additive effect on herbivory. When seaweed was added to mimic deposition by hurricanes, no interactive predator effect occurred. Thus environmental change can substantially restructurefood-web interactions, complicating efforts to predict anthropogenic changes in ecosystem processes.},

We sampled such multiple networks simultaneously in an agroecosystem. We show that the networks varied in their robustness; networks including pollinators appeared to be particularly fragile. We show that, overall, networks did not strongly covary in their robustness, which suggests that ecological restoration (for example, through agri-environment schemes) benefitting one functional group will not inevitably benefit others. Some individual plant species were disproportionately well linked to many other species. This type of information can be used in restoration management, because it identifies the plant taxa that can potentially lead to disproportionate gains in biodiversity.},

abstract = {A heuristic framework for understanding and predicting the distribution and categorical abundance of species in stream communities is presented. The framework requires that species be described in terms of their functional relationships to habitat selective forces or their surrogates, which constitute "filters" occurring at hierarchical landscape scales (ranging from microhabitats to water- sheds or basins). Large-scale filters are viewed as causative or mechanistic agents that constrain expression of local selective forces or biotic potential at lower scales. To join a local com...'Tiunity, species in a regional pool must possess appropriate functional attributes (species traits) to "pass" through the nested filters. Biotic interactions are also a potential filter on local community composition, and they are invoked at the lower hierarchical levels, after species have passed through the physico- chemical habitat filters. Potential landscape filters and their associated selective properties are iden- tified, as are prospective species traits (for invertebrates and fish) that correspond with filters. A categorical niche model is used to illustrate how relative abundances of species in local communities might be predicted from habitat data collected at different scales. The framework emphasizes a biologically based approach to understanding and predicting species distribution and abundance and local community composition by explicitly considering environmen- tal constraints imposed at different scales. As such, it can complement non-mechanistic, correlative approaches to community prediction that often lack generality. Operationalizing the framework will require additional research to specify more clearly 1) the degree to which habitat features at different scales are linked functionally or statistically, 2) what species traits are possessed by strongly inter- active species (e.g., keystones) and which habitat filters most strongly constrain the distribution of these species, and 3) the functional significance of a range of species traits and the extent to which these traits are correlated and hence respond in concert to the presence, or modification, of a particular filter. Multi-scale, mechanistic understanding of specie!H?nvironment relations will likely contribute to better predictions about large scale problems, such as the establishment and spread of exotic species or alterations in community composition with changing land use or climate.

abstract = {This study quantifies the how of energy and biomass from a productive marine system to a relatively unproductive terrestrial system. Biomass from marine food webs (here, the Gulf of California) enters the terrestrial webs of islands and coastal areas through two conduits: (1) shore drift of algal wrack and carrion and (2) colonies of seabirds. Both conduits support dense assemblages of consumers: arthropods are 85-560 times more abundant in the supralittoral than inland and 2.2 times more abundant on islands with seabird colonies than those without. Marine input (MI), not terrestrial primary productivity (TP) by land plants, provides most energy and biomass for terrestrial communities on 16 of 19 study islands. The ratio of perimeter to area (PIA) significantly predicts arthropod abundance on islands and is the major determinant of the relative importance of allochthonous how; we expect PIA ratio to be important wherever transport of nutrients, detritus, and organisms among habitats occurs. Similar transport phenomena generally take place, often with significant impact, on coastal habitats and islands worldwide. Such input subsidizes a diverse array of terrestrial consumers; in many cases, subsidized consumers reach extraordinarily high densities and thus can depress their in situ resources. In general, we propose that such flow is often a key feature of the energetics, structure, and dynamics of populations, food webs, and communities whenever any two habitats, differing in productivity, are juxtaposed.},

abstract = {Food webs in the real world are much more complex than food-web literature would have us believe. This is illustrated by the web of the sand community in the Coachella Valley desert. The biota include 174 species of vascular plants, 138 species of vertebrates, more than 55 species of arachnids, and an unknown (but great) number of microorganisms, insects (2,000-3,000 estimated species), acari, and nematodes. Trophic relations are presented in a series of nested subwebs and delineations of the community. Complexity arises from the large number of interactive species, the frequency of omnivory, age structure, looping, the lack of compartmentalization, and the complexity of the arthropod and soil faunas. Web features found in the Coachella also characterize other communities and should produce equivalently complex webs. If anything, diversity and complexity in most nondesert habitats are greater than those in deserts. Patterns from the Coachella web are compared with theoretical predictions and "empirical generalizations" derived from catalogs of published webs. The Coachella web differs greatly: chains are longer, omnivory and loops are not rare, connectivity is greater (species interact with many more predators and prey), top predators are rare or nonexistent, and prey-to-predator ratios are greater than 1.0. The evidence argues that actual community food webs are extraordinarily more complex than those webs cataloged by theorists. I argue that most cataloged webs are oversimplified caricatures of actual communities. That cataloged webs depict so few species, absurdly low ratios of predators on prey and prey eaten by predators, so few links, so little omnivory, a veritable absence of looping, and such a high proportion of top predators argues strongly that they poorly represent real biological communities. Consequently, the practice of abstracting empirical regularities from such catalogs yields an inaccurate and artifactual view of trophic interactions within communities. Contrary to strong assertions by many theorists, patterns from food webs of real communities generally do not support predictions arising from dynamic and graphic models of food-web structure.},

abstract = {We focus on the implications of movement, landscape variables, and spatial heterogeneity for food web dynamics. Movements of nutrients, detritus, prey, and consumers among habitats are ubiquitous in diverse biomes and can strongly influence population, consumer-resource, food web, and community dynamics. Nutrient and detrital subsidies usually increase primary and secondary productivity, both directly and indirectly. Prey subsidies, by movement of either prey or predators, usually enhance predator abundance beyond what local resources can support. Top-down effects occur when spatially subsidized consumers affect local resources by suppressing key resources and occasionally by initiating trophic cascades. Effects on community dynamics vary with the relative amount of input, the trophic roles of the mobile and recipient entities, and the local food web structure. Landscape variables such as the perimeter/area ratio of the focal habitat, permeability of habitat boundaries, and relative productivity of trophically connected habitats affect the degree and importance of spatial subsidization.},

abstract = {Some islands in the Gulf of California support very high densities of spiders. Spider density is negatively correlated with island size; many small islands support 50-200 spiders per m3 of cactus. Energy for these spiders comes primarily from the ocean and not from in situ productivity by land plants. We explicitly connect the marine and terrestrial systems to show that insular food webs represent one endpoint of the marine web. We describe two conduits for marine energy entering these islands: shore drift and seabird colonies. Both conduits are related to island area, having a much stronger effect on smaller islands. This asymmetric effect helps to explain the exceptionally high spider densities on small islands. Although productivity sets the maximal potential densities, predation (by scorpions) limits realized spider abundance. Thus, prey availability and predation act in concert to set insular spider abundance.},

abstract = {-Food webs in nature have multipIe, reticulate connections between a diversity of consumers and resources. Such complexity affects web dynamics: it first spreads the direct effects of consumption and productivity throughout the web rather than focusing them at particu- lar "trophic levels." Second{\textless} consumer densities are often donor controlled with food from across the trophic spectrum, the herbivore and detrital channels, other habitats, life-history omnivory, and even trophic mutualism. Although consumers usualIy do not affect these re- sources, increased numbers often allow consumers to depress other resources to levels lower than if donor-controlled resources were absent. We propose that such donor-contralled and "multichannel" omnivory IS a general feature of consumer control and central to food web dynamics. This observation is mntrary to the normal practice of inferring dynamics by simpli- fying webs into a few linear "trophic levels," as per "green world" theories. Such theortes do not accommodate common and dynamically important features of rea1 webs such as the ubiquity of donor control and the importance and dynamics of detritus, omnivory3 resources crossing habitats, life history nutrients (as opposed to energy), pathogens, resource defenses, and trophic symbioses. We conclude that trophic cascades and top-down community regulatton as envi- sioned by traphic-IeveI theories are relatively uncommon in nature},

abstract = {Interactions between natural selection and environmental change are well recognized and sit at the core of ecology and evolutionary biology. Reciprocal interactions between ecology and evolution, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, are less well studied, even though they may be critical for understanding the evolution of biological diversity, the structure of communities and the function of ecosystems. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks require that populations alter their environment (niche construction) and that those changes in the environment feed back to influence the subsequent evolution of the population. There is strong evidence that organisms influence their environment through predation, nutrient excretion and habitat modification, and that populations evolve in response to changes in their environment at time-scales congruent with ecological change (contemporary evolution). Here, we outline how the niche construction and contemporary evolution interact to alter the direction of evolution and the structure and function of communities and ecosystems. We then present five empirical systems that highlight important characteristics of eco-evolutionary feedbacks: rotifer-algae chemostats; alewife-zooplankton interactions in lakes; guppy life-history evolution and nutrient cycling in streams; avian seed predators and plants; and tree leaf chemistry and soil processes. The alewife-zooplankton system provides the most complete evidence for eco-evolutionary feedbacks, but other systems highlight the potential for eco-evolutionary feedbacks in a wide variety of natural systems.},

This study evaluates the complementarity of bass, Campostoma, and algae at different seasons, and uses in{\&}{\#}8212;stream experimental manipulations of bass and Campostoma to determine if the patterns resulted from strong interactions between predators, herbivores, and algae. In a 1{\&}{\#}8212;km reach of Brier Creek (south{\&}{\#}8212;central Oklahoma), bass and Campostoma distributions in 14 consecutive pools were inversely related in six of seven censuses conducted from 8 November 1982 to 5 September 1983. Bass and Campostoma co{\&}{\#}8212;ocurred in more than two pools only on two occasions, following the largest floods of the year. Campostoma and algal abundances were inversely related during late summer and in both autumns of this study. This relationship did not hold during the spring, when floods strongly affected algal distributions. During autumn of 1983, we removed bass from a pool, fenced it longtidinally, and added Campostomata to one side (1.4 individuals/m2). Over the next 5 wk, standing crop of algae decreased significantly on the Campostoma side but increased on the control side. In a nearby unmanipulated Campostoma pool, standing crop of algae was consistently low. We added three free{\&}{\#}8212;swimming bass to a Compostoma pool to evaluate presumptive predator{\&}{\#}8212;prey interactions. Within 3 h, the Campostoma moved from the deepest part of the pool to shallow areas. Over the next 5 wk, numbers of grazing Campostoma declined due to behavioral changes, emigration, and (presumably) predation. The standing crop of algae increased significantly 10{\&}{\#}8212;13 d after bass addition. In a second bass{\&}{\#}8212;addition experiment in June 1984, Campostoma responses were almost identical, and algal standing crop in deeper areas increased significantly after 1 wk.

abstract = {A conceptual model of Douglas-fir bark beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae) dynamics and associated host tree mortality across multiple spatial and temporal scales was developed, then used to guide a study of the association between the occurrence of beetle-killed trees and factors that might render trees more susceptible to attack. Longterm records of beetle kill showed that beetle epidemics were associated with windstorms and drought at statewide and local spatial scales. At the landscape scale, beetle kill was associated with (i) portions of the landscape that were potentially drier (southern aspects, lower elevations) and (ii) portions of the landscape that had more mature and old-growth conifer vegetation. The patches of beetle-killed trees were aggregated with respect to other patches at scales of approximately 1 and 4 km. At the scale of the individual tree, there was not a strong relationship between beetle kill and resistance to attack measured by tree growth rate prior to attack. Our results show that landscape-scale phenomena and temporal patterns were more strongly correlated with beetle-kill events than was recent growth history at the scale of individual trees. We suggest that the multi-scale approach we employed is useful for elucidating the relative roles of fine- versus coarse-scale constraints on ecological processes.},

abstract = {Aim We evaluated the structure of metacommunities for each of three vertebrate orders (Chiroptera, Rodentia and Passeriformes) along an extensive elevational gradient. Using elevation as a proxy for variation in abiotic characteristics and the known elevational distributions of habitat types, we assessed the extent to which variation in those factors may structure each metacommunity based on taxon-specific characteristics. Location Manu Biosphere Reserve in the Peruvian Andes. Methods Metacommunity structure is an emergent property of a set of species distributions across geographic or environmental gradients. We analysed elements of metacommunity structure (coherence, range turnover and range boundary clumping) to determine the best-fit structure for each metacommunity along an elevational gradient comprising 13 250-m elevational intervals and 58 species of rodent, 92 species of bat or 586 species of passerine. Results For each taxon, the environmental gradient along which the metacommunity was structured was highly correlated with elevation. Clementsian structure (i.e. groups of species replacing other such groups along the gradient) characterized rodents, with a group of species that was characteristic of rain forests and a group of species that was characteristic of higher elevation habitats (i.e. above 1500 m). Distributions of bats were strongly nested, with more montane communities comprising subsets of species at lower elevations. The structure of the passerine metacommunity was complex and most consistent with a quasi-Clementsian structure. Main conclusions Each metacommunity exhibited a different structure along the same elevational gradient, and each structure can be accounted for by taxon-specific responses to local environmental factors that vary predictably with elevation. The structures of rodent and bird metacommunities suggest species sorting associated with habitat specializations, whereas structure of the bat metacommunity is probably moulded by a combination of species-specific tolerances to increasingly cold, low-productivity environs of higher elevations and the diversity and abundance of food resources associated with particular habitat types.},

abstract = {The metacommunity framework is a powerful platform for evaluating patterns of species distribution in geographic or environmental space. Idealized patterns (checkerboard, Clementsian, evenly spaced, Gleasonian and nested distributions) give the framework shape. Each pattern represents an area in a multidimensional continuum of metacommunity struc- tures; however, the current approach to analysis of spatial structure of metacommunities is incomplete. To address this, we describe additional non-random structures and illustrate how they may be discerned via objective criteria. First, we distinguish three distinct forms of species loss in nested structures, which should improve identification of structuring mechanisms for nested patterns. Second, we define six quasi-structures that are consistent with the conceptual underpin- nings of Clementsian, Gleasonian, evenly spaced and nested distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how combinations of structures at smaller spatial extents may aggregate to form Clementsian structure at larger extents. Tese refinements should facilitate the identification of best-fit patterns, associated structuring mechanisms, and informative scales of analysis and interpretation. Tis conceptual and analytical framework may be applied to network properties within communities (i.e. structure of interspecific interactions) and has broad application in ecology and biogeography},

abstract = {The metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) predicts the effects of body size and temperature on metabolism through considerations of vascular distribution networks and biochemical kinetics. MTE has also been extended to characterise processes from cellular to global levels. MTE has generated both enthusiasm and controversy across a broad range of research areas. However, most efforts that claim to validate or invalidate MTE have focused on testing predictions. We argue that critical evaluation of MTE also requires strong tests of both its theoretical foundations and simplifying assumptions. To this end, we synthesise available information and find that MTE's original derivations require additional assumptions to obtain the full scope of attendant predictions. Moreover, although some of MTE's simplifying assumptions are well supported by data, others are inconsistent with empirical tests and even more remain untested. Further, although many predictions are empirically supported on average, work remains to explain the often large variability in data. We suggest that greater effort be focused on evaluating MTE's underlying theory and simplifying assumptions to help delineate the scope of MTE, generate new theory and shed light on fundamental aspects of biological form and function.},

abstract = {The factors that influence a plant's ability to invade are not well under- stood. Many mechanisms are involved and the relative importance of dif- ferent mechanisms depends on the specific invasion. Here we consider one factor—mycorrhizal symbioses. These symbioses are ubiquitous interactions involving the plants and soil fungi of most terrestrial ecosystems. We de- velop a conceptual framework for considering mycorrhizal symbioses in plant species invasions. The most critical aspects of this framework are: (a) the mycorrhizal status and (b) the growth response of the invading plant, (c) the ability of the plant to associate with different fungi, (d ) the quality of the plant as a host for local fungi and feedback dynamics, (e) the biogeogra- phy and dispersal of the fungi, ( f ) the introduction and spread of the fungi, and ( g) the ecological consequences of the creation of novel mycorrhizas. These aspects can critically influence the trajectory of a plant invasion, and this symbiosis deserves more attention in plant invasion biology},

abstract = {Hydrologic connectivity ( sensu Pringle, 2001) is used here in an$\backslash$necological context to refer to water-mediated transfer of matter,$\backslash$nenergy and/or organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic$\backslash$ncycle. Hydrologic connectivity is essential to the ecological integrity$\backslash$nof the landscape, and reduction or enhancement of this property by$\backslash$nhumans can have major negative environmental effects. Some of these$\backslash$neffects are immediate, localized and, therefore, obvious. For example,$\backslash$nwith respect to migratory fish, a given dam may act to reduce hydrologic$\backslash$nconnectivity (by preventing or impeding migration up or downstream),$\backslash$nwhereas interbasin river transfers enhance this property by allowing$\backslash$nthe dispersal of fish into river basins outside of their range. Less$\backslash$nobvious, are alterations in hydrologic connectivity that exhibit$\backslash$na time lag and manifest themselves at geographic locations far from$\backslash$nthe source of disturbance. An example concerns the cumulative effect$\backslash$nof dams on transport of the inorganic dissolved solute silica. Dams$\backslash$nand associated impoundments can reduce the transport of this compound,$\backslash$nwhich becomes deposited in the bottoms of reservoirs (Humborg et$\backslash$nal ., 2000). The cumulative effects of many dams along a river can$\backslash$npotentially result in a reduction in the amount of silica delivered$\backslash$nto coastal waters, with consequent negative effects on coastal food$\backslash$nweb structure that contribute to eutrophication (Justic et al .,$\backslash$n1995; Turner et al ., 1998). Management and policy decisions regarding$\backslash$nland-use activities and hydropower development are often made in$\backslash$nthe absence of adequate information on hydrologic connectivity in$\backslash$nthe landscape. Our current knowledge of how this property maintains$\backslash$nthe ecological integrity of 'natural' ecosystems is poor due to:$\backslash$n(1) the inherent complexity of water movement within and between$\backslash$nthe atmosphere and surface-subsurface systems; and (2) the extent$\backslash$nand magnitude of human alterations, which often occur before we understand$\backslash$nhow hydrologic connectivity affects ecological patterns in the landscape$\backslash$n(Pringle and Triska, 2000). Hydrologic connectivity is being altered$\backslash$nat a rate unprecedented in geologic history, contributing to dramatic$\backslash$nlosses in global aquatic biodiversity and associated ecosystem integrity$\backslash$n(e.g. Dudgeon, 2000; Pringle et al ., 2000; Rosenberg et al ., 2000).$\backslash$nHumans have already appropriated one-half of the accessible global$\backslash$nfreshwater runoff and this could climb to 70{\%} by 2025 (Postel et$\backslash$nal ., 1996).(...)},

abstract = {Modifications of lower watersheds such as water abstraction, channel modification, landuse changes, nutrient enrichment, and toxic discharge can set off a cascade of events upstream that are often overlooked. This oversight is of particular concern since most rivers are altered by humans in their lower drainages and most published ecological investigations of lotic systems have focused on headwater streams. Factors contributing to ecological processes or biophysical legacies in upper watersheds often go unacknowledged because they occur at disparate geographic locations downstream (e.g., gravel mining, water abstraction, dams) with significant lag times. This paper considers examples of how alterations to streams and rivers in their lower reaches can produce biophysical legacies in upstream reaches on levels from genes to ecosystems. Examples include: 1) genetic- and species-level changes, such as reduced genetic flow and variation in isolated upstream populations; 2) population- and community-level changes that occur when degraded downstream areas act as population `'sinks'' for `'source'' populations of native species upstream or, conversely, as `'source'' populations of exotic species that migrate upstream; and 3) ecosystem- and landscape-level changes (e.g., nutrient cycling, primary productivity, regional patterns of biodiversity) that can occur in headwater systems as a result of downstream habitat deterioration and hydrologic modifications. Finally, a case study from my own research illustrates the importance of careful consideration of downstream-upstream linkages in formulating research questions, designing experiments, making predictions, and interpreting results. The effects of dams and associated water abstraction in lowland streams of Puerto Rico has forced my colleagues and me to re-evaluate the results of ecological research that we have conducted in highland streams over the past decade and to redirect our research to consider downstream-upstream linkages.},

abstract = {Nutrient-diffusing substrata (sand-agar plates) were combined with an in situ, flow-through bioassay system to experimentally separate effects of substratum and water enrichment on algal communities in a phosphorus-poor stream in northern Michigan, USA. Glass slides and both control and fertilized sand-agar substrata (N:P -16) were exposed to low ambient nutrient levels in a phosphorus-limited stream (N:P -40) and to water amended with nitrogen and phosphorus (N:P -16). Quantitative cell counts of periphyton taxa and microscopic examination of intact communities on sand-agar substrata indicated that motile biraphid diatom taxa (e.g., Na-vicula and Nitzschia spp.) responded to nutrients in both the water and substratum, attaining spatial dominance in the upper canopy. These upperstory taxa comprised {\textgreater} 50{\%} total algal biovolume on sand-agar substrata and appeared to interfere with the response of sessile understory taxa (e.g., Achnanthes minutissima, Cocconeis placentula) to inorganic nutrient amendments to the water. Sessile taxa did respond to inorganic nutrients added to the water when growing on glass slides, where algal communities lacked a dense motile up-perstory, indicating that substratum type can influence the nature of periphyton taxon response to nutrients. Periphyton community physiognomy and interactions between taxa are interrelating factors regulating algal response to nutrients from different sources. In addition, the form of phosphorus enrichment (inorganic vs. organic) influenced algal growth, physiognomy, and taxon composition. Algal response to the form of phosphorus was dependent on the source of the nutrient (water vs. substratum) and substratum type. Taxon diversity was greater on all nutrient treatments relative to controls on both substratum types. Diversity and species richness were highest on enriched substrata exposed to low ambient nutrient levels, relative to more homogeneous nutrient regimes where communities on enriched substrata were exposed to water amended with nutrients. Results indicate that nutrient spatial heterogeneity between substratum and water is a mechanism maintaining the species diversity of periphytic algae.},

abstract = {This paper applies concepts of landscape ecology and patch dynamics to lotic systems. We present a framework for the investigation of pattern and process in lotic ecosystems that considers how specific patch characteristics determine biotic and abiotic processes over various scales. Patch characteristics include: size, size distribution within the landscape, juxtaposition, diversity, duration, and mechanisms affecting patch formation. Several topics of current interest in lotic ecology are examined from a patch-dynamics perspective: (1) response of periphyton communities to nutrient patches; (2) effects of patch dynamics on nutrient spiralling; (3) riparian patch dynamics and effects of leaf litter characteristics on lotic food webs; (4) beaver-induced patch dynamics; and (5) patch dynamics of river floodplains. We conclude that a patch-dynamics perspective coupled with a strong experimental approach can enhance the utility and predictive power of unifying concepts in lotic ecology, such as the river continuum hypothesis and nutrient spiralling, through its focus on organismal and process-specific building blocks of lotic systems. The effectiveness of a patch-dynamics approach as a framework for the study of lotic systems lies in the strength of the linkage between reductionist and whole- stream perspectives.},

abstract = {Effects of substratum and water nutrient perturbations on periphyton growth were assessed in a nutrient-poor stream by combining a substratum enrichment technique with a flow-through bioassay system. Periphyton growth (chlorophyll a, total biovolume) responded to combined influences of water and substratum enrichment in an additive manner when both compartments were amended with N and P to yield an optimal ratio (N:P simeq 16:1). When NO-3-N was added to the substratum and PO-4-P to the water, algal growth response was synergistic. Analysis of the vertical distribution of P fractions in cores taken from nutrient-diffusing substrata indicates that attached microorganisms mediate P release from underlying substrate, acting as a filter or temporary sink. Nutrient-diffusing substrata are useful detectors of limiting nutrients in aquatic systems; however, their function and application differ from water enrichment assays where nutrients are added at a constant rate. Differences are partially attributed to spatial and temporal variability of nutrient release and the strictly localized influence of substratum flora on ambient water chemistry. ------------------------------------------------------------------------Enregistrement 97 de 166 - BA on CD January - December 1987},

Theory predicts predominantly positive associations but tests within single sites have shown variable relationships, and associations between plant and microbial diversity across broad spatial scales remain largely unexplored. We compared the diversity of plant, bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities in one hundred and forty-five 1 m2 plots across 25 temperate grassland sites from four continents. Across sites, the plant alpha diversity patterns were poorly related to those observed for any soil microbial group. However, plant beta diversity (compositional dissimilarity between sites) was significantly correlated with the beta diversity of bacterial and fungal communities, even after controlling for environmental factors. Thus, across a global range of temperate grasslands, plant diversity can predict patterns in the composition of soil microbial communities, but not patterns in alpha diversity.},

abstract = {Ample evidence suggests that ecological communities can exhibit historical contingencies. However, few studies have explored whether differences in assembly history can generate alternative local community states in metacommunities in which local communities are linked by dispersal. In a protist microcosm experiment, we examined the influence of species colonization history on metacommunity assembly under homogeneous environmental conditions, by manipulating both the sequence of species colonization into local communities and the rate of dispersal among local communities. Whereas the role of dispersal in structuring local communities decreased over time and became non-significant towards the end of the experiment, species colonization history significantly influenced local communities throughout the experiment. Local communities, regardless of the rate of dispersal among them, exhibited two alternative states characterized by the dominance of different species. The alternative community states, however, emerged in the absence of priority effects that were often associated with alternative community states found in other assembly studies. Rather, they were driven by variation in species interaction strength among local communities with different assembly histories. These results suggest that dispersal among local communities may not necessarily reduce the role of species colonization history in shaping metacommunity assembly, and that differences in species colonization history need to be explicitly considered as an important factor in causing heterogeneous community states in metacommunities.},

abstract = {Applications of Hutchinson's n-dimensional niche concept are often focused on the role of interspecific competition in shaping species distribution patterns. In this paper, I discuss a variety of factors, in addition to competition, that influence the observed relationship between species distribution and the availability of suitable habitat. In particular, I show that Hutchinson's niche concept can be modified to incorporate the influences of niche width, habitat availability and dispersal, as well as interspecific competition per se. I introduce a simulation model called NICHE that embodies many of Hutchinson's original niche concepts and use this model to predict patterns of species distribution. The model may help to clarify how dispersal, niche size and competition interact, and under what conditions species might be common in unsuitable habitat or absent from suitable habitat. A brief review of the pertinent literature suggests that species are often absent from suitable habitat and present in unsuitable habitat, in ways predicted by theory. However, most tests of niche theory are hampered by inadequate consideration of what does and does not constitute suitable habitat. More conclusive evidence for these predictions will require rigorous determination of habitat suitability under field conditions. I suggest that to do this, ecologists must measure habitat specific demography and quantify how demographic parameters vary in response to temporal and spatial variation in measurable niche dimensions},

abstract = {In the model described, we attempt to link breeding-site selection to population dynamics for situations in which there is more than one distinct type of habitat. The distribution of individuals between habitat types depends on the selective abilities of the species. This distribution, in turn, influences the population dynamics of the species as a whole. We show that the consequences of habitat selection on population dynamics for an ideal free distribution of individuals across habitats is predictably different from what would be predicted if habitat selection were preemptive, that is, if individuals, upon selecting a site, prevented others from sharing the site. If preemptive selection is ideal, average reproductive success declines with increasing density because each individual selects the best site available from those sites not yet occupied. The model allows us to compare the relative contribution of different types of habitats to a species' growth rate and population size. Furthermore, we can also predict how the loss of habitat of a particular type may affect a population. This should make the model useful for environmental management problems as well as for describing the present distribution of a species across a spatially heterogeneous landscape.},

abstract = {1. Riparian zones hold a central place in the hydrological cycle, owing to the prevalence of surface and groundwater interactions. Ln riparian transition zones, the quality of exfiltrating water is heavily influenced by microbial activities within the bed sediments. This paper reviews the role of micro-organisms in biogeochemical cycling in the riparian-hyporheic ecotone. 2. The production of organic substances, such as cellulose and lignin, by riparian vegetation is an important factor influencing the pathways of microbial processing in the riparian zone. For example, anaerobic sediment patches, created by entrainment of allochthonous organic matter, are focal sites of microbial denitrification. 3. The biophysical structure of the riparian zone largely influences in-stream microbial transformations through the retention of organic matter. Particulate and dissolved organic matter (POM and DOM) is retained effectively in the hyporheic zone, which drives biofilm development and associated microbial activity. 4. The structure of the riparian zone, the mechanisms of POM retention, the hydrological linkages to the stream and the intensity of key biogeochemical processes vary greatly along the river continuum and in relation to the geomorphic setting. However, the present state of knowledge of organic matter metabolism in the hyporheic zone suggests that lateral ecological connectivity is a basic attribute of lotic ecosystems. 5. Due to their efficiency in transforming POM into heterotrophic microbial biomass, attached biofilms form an abundant food resource for an array of predators and grazers in the interstitial environments of rivers and streams. The interstitial microbial loop, and the intensity of microbial production within the bed sediments, may be a primary driver of the celebrated high productivity and biodiversity of the riparian zone. 6. New molecular methods based on the analysis of the low molecular weight RNA (LMW RNA) allow unprecedented insights into the community structure of natural bacterial assemblages and also allow identification and study of specific strains hitherto largely unknown. 7. Research is needed on the development and evaluation of sampling methods for interstitial micro-organisms, on the characterization of biofilm structure, on the analysis of the biodegradable matter in the riparian-hyporheic ecotone, on the regulation mechanisms exerted on microbiota by interstitial predators and grazers, and on measures of microbial respiration and other key activities that influence biogeochemical cycles in running waters. 8. Past experiences from large-scale alterations of riparian zones by humans, such as the River Rhine in central Europe, undeniably demonstrate the detrimental consequences of disconnecting rivers from their riparian zones. A river management approach that uses the natural services of micro-organisms within intact riparian zones could substantially reduce the costs of clean, sustainable water supplies for humans.

The trend in ecological literature is to treat corridors and boundaries as separate phenomena on the landscape. This approach, however, misses a fundamental aspect they have in common: their strong influence on ecological flows. Corridors and boundaries exist at opposite ends of a permeability gradient, differing in their effects on rates and direction of flow. The position of landscape structures along this permeability gradient depends on attributes of both the flow and of the structure itself. We discuss boundaries and corridors in terms of mover specificity, scale, and effects on different levels of ecological organization, using rivers and streams to illustrate our points. We predict which structures will act as boundaries or corridors and at what spatial and temporal scales they are likely to be relevant. Considering the function of landscape structures across the boundary-corridor continuum will provide researchers and managers with a more complete, holistic viewpoint and will allow better strategies to attain conservation goals.

Here we argue that empirical evidence supports a model whereby ecological factors associated with resource availability regulate species richness at continental scales. Any large-scale predictive model for biological diversity must explain three robust patterns in the natural world. First, species richness for evolutionary biotas is highly correlated with resource-associated surrogate variables, including area, temperature, and productivity. Second, species richness across epochal timescales is largely stationary in time. Third, the dynamics of diversity exhibit clear and predictable responses to mass extinctions, key innovations, and other perturbations. Collectively, these patterns are readily explained by a model in which species richness is regulated by diversity-dependent feedback mechanisms. We argue that many p...},

abstract = {Diversified bet-hedging, a strategy that leads several individuals with the same genotype to express distinct phenotypes in a given generation, is now well established as a common evolutionary response to environmental stochasticity. Life-history traits defined as diversified bet-hedging (e.g. germination or diapause strategies) display marked differences between populations in spatial proximity. In order to find out whether such differences can be explained by local adaptations to spatially heterogeneous environmental stochasticity, we explored the evolution of bet-hedging dormancy strategies in a metapopulation using a two-patch model with patch differences in stochastic juvenile survival. We found that spatial differences in the level of environmental stochasticity, restricted dispersal, increased fragmentation and intermediate survival during dormancy all favour the adaptive diversification of bet-hedging dormancy strategies. Density dependency also plays a major role in the diversification of dormancy strategies because: (i) it may interact locally with environmental stochasticity and amplify its effects; however, (ii) it can also generate chaotic population dynamics that may impede diversification. Our work proposes new hypotheses to explain the spatial patterns of bet-hedging strategies that we hope will encourage new empirical studies of this topic.},

abstract = {Contemporary cities are expanding rapidly in a spatially complex, non-linear manner. However, this form of expansion is rarely taken into account in the way that urbanization is classically assessed in ecological studies. An explicit consideration of the temporal dynamics, although frequently missing, is crucial in order to understand the effects of urbanization on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in rapidly urbanizing landscapes. In particular, a temporal perspective highlights the importance of land-use legacies and transient dynamics in the response of biodiversity to environmental change. Here, we outline the essential elements of an emerging framework for urban ecology that incorporates the characteristics of contemporary urbanization and thus empowers ecologists to understand and intervene in the planning and management of cities. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This will not only enable a better identification of diversity patterns, but will also shed more light on the associated environmental conditions, spatial locations, and seasonal fluctuations, which could explain such patterns. Complex ecological questions may now be addressed using multivariate statistical analyses, which represent a vast potential of techniques that are still underexploited. Here, well-established exploratory and hypothesis-driven approaches are reviewed, so as to foster their addition to the microbial ecologist toolbox. Because such tools aim at reducing data set complexity, at identifying major patterns and putative causal factors, they will certainly find many applications in microbial ecology.},

abstract = {1. We examined microbial respiration among streams in lowland Costa Rica comprising a natural phosphorus gradient (5-350 mug SRP L-1) resulting from variable inputs of solute-rich (e.g. P, SO4 and Cl) groundwater. 2. Microbial respiration rates were determined by measuring oxygen change in situ in nine low-order streams on three substrate types: mixed leaves collected from the stream bottom, conditioned Ficus leaves and sediments. 3. Respiration rates on both leaf types were positively related to phosphorus and negatively related to N : P ratios. Microbial respiration rates on sediments were not related to any of the variables [i.e. soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), N-NO3 and N : P] measured. 4. Respiration rates on newly colonised Ficus leaves formed an asymptotic curve increasing to a plateau, suggesting that saturation with phosphorus occurred at concentrations {\textless} 15 {\&}mu;g SRP L-1. 5. To test the hypothesis that phosphorus was the main solute in solute-rich water that was driving observed differences in microbial respiration rates, we artificially enriched a small stream with phosphorus and measured changes in respiration before and after enrichment. 6. Experimental phosphorus enrichment produced increases in respiration rates similar in magnitude to those observed in the nine streams forming the natural phosphorus gradient, supporting our hypothesis that phosphorus was the major variable driving interstream differences in microbial respiration rates. Respiration rates were higher in this study than those reported for most other tropical streams and rivers with the exception of those reported for tropical Asian streams. 7. Results indicate that variations in phosphorus concentrations can potentially affect patterns of microbial respiration rates at a landscape level via differential inputs of solute-rich groundwater into streams.},

Currently, only 26 of the approximately 52 identifiable major lineages, or phyla, within the domain Bacteria have cultivated representatives. Evidence from field studies indicates that many of the uncultivated phyla are found in diverse habitats, and some are extraordinarily abundant. In some important environments, including seawater, freshwater, and soil, many biologically and geochemically important organisms are at best only remotely related to any strain that has been characterized by phenotype or by genome sequencing. Genome sequence information that would allow ribosomal RNA gene trees to be related to broader patterns in microbial genome evolution is scant, and therefore microbial diversity remains largely unexplored territory.},

abstract = {Natural mires and forested peatlands are known to be very significant sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to aquatic ecosystems. Peatland management operations (e.g., forestry operations, restoration of drained mires and peat mining) and extreme hydrological events may increase the DOC runoff. We hypothesized that an increase in phosphorus (P) leaching, together with near-neutral conditions in recipient lakes will accelerate decomposition of DOC that originates from acidic, nutrient-poor mire waters. The efficiency of DOC utilization was evaluated by measuring microbial respiration and bacterial production (BP) in short-term laboratory experiments with runoff waters from six boreal mire sites. Mere inorganic phosphorus (PO4-P) addition did not affect the rate of respiration or the proportion of decayed DOC. However, in the nutrient-poor bog waters, P addition slightly promoted BP and bacterial growth efficiency (BGE). In contrast, the elevation of pH alone, and the elevation of pH and PO4-P level together, caused a significant increase in respiration and in the proportion of decayed DOC, but did not affect net BP. Elevated pH alone, however, depressed BGE when compared to that under the combined elevation of pH and PO4-P. These results suggest that the increased P availability, e.g., after mire restoration, would slightly benefit bacterial net growth in P-limited waters. However, in near-neutral recipient lakes, the increased microbial decomposition of mire-originated DOC contributes more to carbon dioxide (CO2) supersaturation than potentially supporting detritus-based food chains.},

abstract = {Human activities affect the natural environment at local to global scales. To understand these effects, knowledge derived from short-term studies on small plots needs to be projected to much broader spatial and temporal scales. One way to project short-term, plot-scale knowledge to broader scales is to embed that knowledge in a mechanistic model of the ecosystem. The National Science Foundation's Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network makes two vital contributions to this type of modeling effort: (1) a commitment to multidisciplinary research at individual sites, which results in a broad range of mutually consistent data, and (2) long-term data sets essential for estimating rate constants for slow ecosystem processes that dominate long-term ecosystem dynamics. In this article, we present four examples of how a mechanistic approach to modeling ecological processes can be used to make projections to broader scales. The models are all applied to sites in the LTER Network.},

To address this need, a group of social, earth, and life scientists associated with the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network have articulated a conceptual framework for understanding the human dimensions of ecological change for the LTER Network. This framework explicitly advocates that what is often divided into “natural” and human systems be considered a single, complex social-ecological system (SES). In this paper, we propose a list of core social science research areas, concepts, and questions; identify the need for multiscale investigatory frameworks crucial for implementing integrated research; and suggest practical approaches for integration. In sum, this paper is a general outline for empirical and cross-site research projects where investigators agree that bringing together social, biological, and earth scientists can lead to synthetic approaches and a unified understanding of the mechanisms regulating SES. Although the motivation for this goal is specific to the LTER Network and similar projects, we believe that the issues and ideas presented here are widely applicable to other interdisciplinary SES studies.},

It describes the role of cities in the expanding human ecological niche and its implications for sustainable urban development. I have used a new technique, ecological footprint analysis, to convert the material and energy flows required to sustain the human population and industrial metabolism of the city into a landecosystem area equivalent. This approach emphasizes that, although urbanization has become the dominant human settlement pattern, cities themselves constitute only a small part of the total ecological space appropriated by their human inhabitants. In short, the ecological locations of human settlements no longer coincide with their geographic locations. Every city and urban region depends for its existence and growth on a globally diffuse productive hinterland up to 200 times the size of the city itself. Cities are therefore increasingly vulnerable to global ecological change and geopolitical instability. Given the deteriorating state of the ecosphere, policies to decrease the ecological footprint of cities while increasing regional self-reliance may enhance urban sustainability},

abstract = {We define disturbance in stream ecosystems to be: any relatively discrete event in time that is characterized by a frequency, intensity, and severity outside a predictable range, and that disrupts ecosystem, community, or population structure and changes resources or the physical environment. Of the three major hypotheses relating disturbance to lotic community structure, the dynamic equilibrium hypothesis appears to be generally applicable, although specific studies support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and the equilibrium model. Differences in disturbance frequency between lentic and lotic systems may explain why biotic interactions are more apparent in lakes than in streams. Responses to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances vary regionally, as illustrated by examples from the mid-continent, Pacific northwest, and southeastern United States. Based on a generalized framework of climatic-biogeochemical characteristics, two features are considered to be most significant in choosing streams for comparative studies of disturbance: hydrologic regimes and comparable geomorphology. A method is described for quantifying predictability of the hydrologic regime based on long-term records of monthly maximum and minimum stream flows. Different channel forms (boulder and cobble, alluvial gravelbed, alluvial sandbed) have different responses to hydrologic disturbance from spates. A number of structural and functional components for comparing disturbance effects within regions and across biomes are presented. Experimental approaches to studying disturbance involve spatial-scale considerations, logistic difficulties, and ethical questions. General questions related to disturbance that could be addressed by stream ecologists are proposed.},

abstract = {Tree invasions of grasslands are occurring globally, with profound consequences for ecosystem structure and function. We explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of tree invasion of a montane meadow in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, where meadow loss is a conservation concern. We examine the early stages of invasion, where extrinsic and intrinsic processes can be clearly delineated. In a 0.21-ha plot, we mapped and aged 929 trees ≥0.3-m tall, yielding a detailed record of the spatio-temporal dynamics of invasion. For the primary species, Abies grandis and Pinus contorta, we correlated age structures (unimodal in both species) with climate (precipitation, temperature, and snowpack) and cone production, but found weak or non-significant relationships. Evidence of biotic interactions within and between species was obtained by examining the spatial associations of trees to a distance of 5 m and how these changed over time. We used multiple methods including uni- and bivariate forms of the Ripley's K and pair-correlation function (pcf) (corrected for inhomogeneity), the J-function, an evolving nearest-neighbor metric, and a test for directional bias in establishment. Pinus and Abies contributed in contrasting ways to the pace and spatial structure of invasion. Shade-intolerant Pinus tended to establish in the open, initiating clusters. In contrast, shade-tolerant Abies established in association with Pinus or in conspecific clusters. Preferential establishment of Abies to the north of older Pinus suggests that facilitation occurs by shading. The factors responsible for initial establishment remain unresolved, but positive interactions are pivotal in accelerating invasions, once initiated.

abstract = {Riparian areas of large streams provide important habitat to many species and control many instream processes – but is the same true for the margins of small streams? This review con- siders riparian areas alongside small streams in forested, moun- tainous areas of the Pacific Northwest and asks if there are fundamental ecological differences from larger streams and from other regions and if there are consequences for management from any differences. In the moist forests along many small streams of the Pacific Northwest, the contrast between the streamside and upslope forest is not as strong as that found in drier regions. Small streams typically lack floodplains, and the riparian area is often constrained by the hillslope. Nevertheless, riparian-associated organisms, some unique to headwater areas, are found along small streams. Disturbance of hillslopes and stream channels and micro- climatic effects of streams on the riparian area provide great het- erogeneity in processes and diversity of habitats. The tight coupling of the terrestrial riparian area with the aquatic system results from the closed canopy and high edge-to-area ratio for small streams. Riparian areas of the temperate, conifer dominated forests of the Pacific Northwest provide a unique environment. Forest manage- ment guidelines for small streams vary widely, and there has been little evaluation of the local or downstream consequences of forest practices along small streams.},

abstract = {Traditional approaches to the study of fragmented landscapes invoke an island-ocean model and assume that the nonhabitat matrix surrounding remnant patches is uniform. Patch isolation, a crucial parameter to the predictions of island biogeography and metapopulation theories, is measured by distance alone. To test whether the type of interpatch matrix can contribute significantly to patch isolation, I conducted a mark-recapture study on a butterfly community inhabiting meadows in a naturally patchy landscape. I used maximum likelihood to estimate the relative resistances of the two major matrix types (willow thicket and conifer forest) to butterfly movement between meadow patches. For four of the six butterfly taxa (subfamilies or tribes) studied, conifer was 3-12 times more resistant than willow. For the two remaining taxa (the most vagile and least vagile in the community), resistance estimates for willow and conifer were not significantly different, indicating that responses to matrix differ even among closely related species. These results suggest that the surrounding matrix can significantly influence the "effective isolation" of habitat patches, rendering them more or less isolated than simple distance or classic models would indicate. Modification of the matrix may provide opportunities for reducing patch isolation and thus the extinction risk of populations in fragmented landscapes.},

I suggest that the distributions of species within a region reveal more about the processes that generate diversity patterns than does the co-occurrence of species at any given point. The local community is an epiphenomenon that has relatively little explanatory power in ecology and evolutionary biology. Local coexistence cannot provide insight into the ecogeographic distributions of species within a region, from which local assemblages of species derive, nor can local communities be used to test hypotheses concerning the origin, maintenance, and regulation of species richness, either locally or regionally.

abstract = {Patterns of diversity within large regional biotas express the outcomes of processes, operating on both regional and local scales, that influence evolutionary diversification as well as the distribution and abundance of species. Regional analyses of species distributions suggest that neither ecological sorting of species based on their adaptations to the physical environment, nor interactions between competing species, adequately explain patterns of species richness. Potentially competing species appear to utilise broadly overlapping resources with similar proficiency. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses reveal that species abundances and distributions within regions vary independently of evolutionary relationship. This implies the existence of dynamic, species-specific controls on population growth, as could be applied by specialised pathogens or other antagonists. Here, I argue that the changing balance of coevolved interactions between hosts and their antagonists shapes the distribution and abundance of individual host populations as well as patterns of local species richness. Geographical expansion creates allopatric populations and thereby could promote diversification; contraction ultimately leads to extinction. This taxon-cycle dynamic links regional diversity and distribution to intrinsic biological interactions independently of extrinsic ecological conditions. These hypotheses emphasise the central importance of investigating the impacts of pathogens on species abundance and distribution, and the potential consequences of coevolutionary changes in pathogen-host relationships for species formation and extinction.},

abstract = {Taxon cycles are sequential phases of expansion and contraction of the ranges of species, associated generally with shifts in ecological distribution. The important contribution of the taxon cycle to biogeographical analysis is its emphasis on evolutionary and ecological interactions among colonizing and resident species, which influence their extinction dynamics and establish patterns of geographical distribution. Taxon cycles were inferred originally from the distribution of species across island archipelagos, where a correlation was noted between gaps in island occupancy and the degree of phenotypic differentiation. This pattern implied that phases of colonization were followed by range contraction, while endemic Antillean species that were undifferentiated between islands suggested secondary expansion and the beginning of a new cycle. This interpretation was met with scepticism, but reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships from gene sequences has now permitted us to characterize taxon cycles in Lesser Antillean birds. The relative timing of phases of the cycle can be deduced from genetic divergence between island populations. We have found that taxon cycles have periods in the order of 106�years and that cycles in different lineages occur independently of each other and independently of Pleistocene climate cycles. Individual island populations may persist for several millions of years on the larger islands of the Lesser Antilles; occasional expansion phases lead to the replacement of island populations that have disappeared, thus reducing the archipelago-wide rate of extinction to nil. What drives taxon cycles is unknown, but we speculate that they may be caused by co-evolution with enemy populations, and a probable mechanism would involve infrequent mutations influencing parasite virulence and avian host disease resistance. Taxon cycles undoubtedly occur on continents, but the geographical configuration of island archipelagos reveals more clearly their presence and invites their study.},

The absence of alternative combinations of these variables implies constraint on the diversification of life histories, but the nature of this constraint remains elusive. Here,we argue that individual and adaptive responses to different environments are limited by physiological mechanisms. Although energy and materials allocations are important results of physiological tradeoffs, endocrine control mechanisms can produce incompatible physiological states that restrict life histories to a single dominant axis of variation.

Despite extensive knowledge about food web interactions and pelagic ecosystem functioning, information about the bacterial community composition in the Baltic Sea is scarce. We hypothesized that due to the eutrophic low-salinity environment and the long water residence time ({\textgreater}5 years), the bacterioplankton community from the Baltic proper shows a native "brackish" composition influenced by both freshwater and marine phylotypes. The bacterial community composition in surface water (3-m depth) was examined at a single station throughout a full year. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed that the community composition changed over the year. Further, it indicated that at the four extensive samplings (16S rRNA gene clone libraries and bacterial isolates from low- and high-nutrient agar plates and seawater cultures), different bacterial assemblages associated with different environmental conditions were present. Overall, the sequencing of 26 DGGE bands, 160 clones, 209 plate isolates, and 9 dilution culture isolates showed that the bacterial assemblage in surface waters of the central Baltic Sea was dominated by Bacteroidetes but exhibited a pronounced influence of typical freshwater phylogenetic groups within Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Betaproteobacteria and a lack of typical marine taxa. This first comprehensive analysis of bacterial community composition in the central Baltic Sea points to the existence of an autochthonous estuarine community uniquely adapted to the environmental conditions prevailing in this brackish environment.},

abstract = {Edge effects have been studied for decades because they are a key component to understanding how landscape structure influences habitat quality. However, making sense of the diverse patterns and extensive variability reported in the literature has been difficult because there has been no unifying conceptual framework to guide research. In this review, we identify four fundamental mechanisms that cause edge responses: ecological flows, access to spatially separated resources, resource mapping, and species interactions. We present a conceptual framework that identifies the pathways through which these four mechanisms can influence distributions, ultimately leading to new ecological communities near habitat edges. Next, we examine a predictive model of edge responses and show how it can explain much of the variation reported in the literature. Using this model, we show that, when observed, edge responses are largely predictable and consistent. When edge responses are variable for the same species at the same edge type, observed responses are rarely in opposite directions. We then show how remaining variability may be understood within our conceptual frameworks. Finally, we suggest that, despite all the research in this area, the development of tools to extrapolate edge responses to landscapes has been slow, restricting our ability to use this information for conservation and management.

Geomorphological and fractal properties of OCNs are known from earlier studies by the authors. This paper explores further the structures derived by optimization of energy dissipation rates. Optimality of subnetworks and of basin shapes is investigated as a by-product of competition for drainage. A new perspective on the possible prediction of the width function of a basin network, and hence of its hydrologic response, is obtained by exploiting OCN techniques, requiring only the definition of the outer boundaries of the basin. The interplay between hillslope processes and the development of drainage networks is addressed, aiming at the relative role and the mutual interrelations of geology and optimal organization in the structure of mature river basins. Also addressed is the issue of multiscaling and multifractality in the spatial organization of the network. It is concluded that OCN approaches provide a comprehensive framework for the study of the morphology of geophysical structures.},

abstract = {The interaction of fast and slow processes is an integral part of the sudden large shifts that sometimes occur in ecosystems. To study the effects of slow/fast variables on ecosystems, we used a range of examples from natural and exploited aquatic and terrestrial systems. So-called catastrophic bifurcations in the dynamics of the fast components are at the heart of such dramatic shifts. We discuss some of the most important bifurcations and show how they can be analyzed. Subsequently, we show how the interaction with slowly changing variables can be understood from graphs constructed in a simple way using the singular perturbation approach.},

abstract = {Algae and Cyanobacteria in Extreme Environments is a unique collection of essays, contributed by leading scientists from around the world, devoted to algae – and some related microbes – observed in unexpected harsh habitats, which it seems are an oasis or Garden of Eden for these organisms. This timely book on Extremophilic algae, including its especially impressive micrographs, may provide clues about the edges of life on Earth and possibly elsewhere in the universe. Defining locations from the anthropomorphic point of view, the environments explored ranges from severe and distant to “normal” places. The algae discussed, microbial oxygenic phototrophs, are classified into various categories according to their habitats. They thrive in various temperature ranges, at the limits of pH values, in salt solutions, under UV radiation, dryness, heavy metals, anaerobic niches, under various levels of illuminations, and under hydrostatic pressure. Authors discuss bio-diversely algal territories ecologically – the hot springs with the thermophiles or acido-thermophiles; Antarctica, the Arctic, and permafrost zones with their cold lovers (Psychrophiles); soda lakes with the alkaliphiles, saltine areas with halophiles. In addition to general essays, Algal species discussed in detail include diatoms, Cyanidium, Galdieria, Dunaliella, and Chroococcidiopsis. This volume is a must for students of the field of biodiversity, as well as those in phycology, ecology and general biological research.},

abstract = {This study examined the long-term changes in community assembly, resistance, and resilience of macroinvertebrates following 10 years of experimental floods in a flow regulated river. Physico-chemistry, macroinvertebrates, and periphyton biomass were monitored before and sequentially after each of 22 floods, and drift/seston was collected during six separate floods over the study period. The floods reduced the density and taxon richness of macroinvertebrates, and a nonmetric dimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis distinguished temporal shifts in community assembly. Resistance (measured as the relative lack of loss in density) tofloods varied among taxa, and the abundance of resistant taxa was related to the temporal changes in community assembly. Community resistance was inversely related to flood magnitude with all larger floods ({\textgreater} 25 m3/s, {\textgreater} 16-fold over baseflow) reducing densities by {\textgreater} 75{\%} regardless of flood year, whereas smaller floods ({\textless} 20 m3/s) reduced taxon richness approximately twofold less than larger floods. No relationship was found between flood magnitude and the relative loss in periphyton biomass. Resilience was defined as the recovery slope (positive slope of a parameter with time following each flood) and was unrelated to shifts in community assembly or resistance. Macroinvertebrate drift and seston demonstrated hysteresis (i.e., a temporal response in parameter quantity with change in discharge) during each flood, although larger floods typically had two peaks in both parameters. The first peak was a response to the initial increases in flow, whereas the second peak was associated with streambed disturbance (substrate mobility) and side-slope failure causing increased scour. Drift density was 3-9 times greater and that of seston 3-30 times greater during larger floods than smaller floods. These results demonstrate temporal shifts in macroinvertebrate community assembly toward a pre-dam assemblage following sequential floods in this flow regulated river, thus confirming the ecological role of habitat filtering in organism distribution and abundance. Community resistance and resilience were unrelated to shifts in community assembly, suggesting that they are mostly evolutionary properties of ecosystems as populations adapt to changing environmental (disturbance regimes) and biotic (novel colonists) conditions. As these systems show behaviors similar to dispersal-limited ecosystems, a long-term perspective is required for management actions targeted toward regulated and fragmented rivers.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic pressures on the Earth System have reached a scale where abrupt global environmental change can no longer be excluded. We propose a new approach to global sustainability in which we define planetary boundaries within which we expect that humanity can operate safely. Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems. We have identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing upon current scientific understanding, we propose quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO2 concentration in the atmosphere {\textless}350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W m-2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80{\%} of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone ({\textless}5{\%} reduction in O3 concentration from pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N2 to 35 Tg N yr-1) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use ({\textless}4000 km3 yr-1 of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change ({\textless}15{\%} of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of {\textless}10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which we have not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading. We estimate that humanity has already transgressed three planetary boundaries: for climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, and changes to the global nitrogen cycle. Planetary boundaries are interdependent, because transgressing one may both shift the position of other boundaries or cause them to be transgressed. The social impacts of transgressing boundaries will be a function of the social–ecological resilience of the affected societies. Our proposed boundaries are rough, first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps. Filling these gaps will require major advancements in Earth System and resilience science. The proposed concept of “planetary boundaries” lays the groundwork for shifting our approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative externalities, toward the estimation of the safe space for human development. Planetary boundaries define, as it were, the boundaries of the “planetary playing field” for humanity if we want to be sure of avoiding major human-induced environmental change on a global scale.},

In this personal opinion I have concentrated on those processes where soil moisture is the key link between climate fluctuations and vegetation dynamics in space and time. The soil moisture balance equation at a site is shown to be the keystone of numerous fundamental questions which may be instrumental in the quantitative linkage between hydrologic dynamics and ecological patterns and processes. Some of those questions are outlined here, and possible avenues of attack are suggested. The space-time links between climate, soil, and vegetation are also explored from the hydrologic perspective, and some exciting research perspectives are outlined.},

It addresses a wide range of related topics, including biodiversity of freshwater fish in river networks and vegetation along riparian systems, how river networks affected historic spreading of human populations, and how they influence the spreading of water-borne diseases. Given the commonalities among various dendritic structures and despite the variety and complexity of the ecosystems involved, we present here an integrated line of research addressing the above and related topics through a unique, coherent ecohydrological thread and similar mathematical methods. Metacommunity and individual-based models are studied in the context of hydrochory, population, and species migrations and the spreading of infections of water-borne diseases along the ecological corridors of river basins. A general theory emerges on the effects of dendritic geometries on the ecological processes and dynamics operating on river basins that will establish a new significant scientific branch. Insights provided by such a theory will lend themselves to issues of great practical importance such as integration of riparian systems into large-scale resource management, spatial strategies to minimize loss of freshwater biodiversity, and effective prevention campaigns against water-borne diseases.},

abstract = {The redox dye 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) was employed for direct epifluorescent microscopic enumeration of respiring bacteria in environmental samples. Oxidized CTC is nearly colorless and is nonfluorescent; however, the compound is readily reduced via electron transport activity to fluorescent, insoluble CTC-formazan, which accumulates intracellularly. Bacteria containing CTC-formazan were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy in wet-mount preparations, on polycarbonate membrane filter surfaces, or in biofilms associated with optically opaque surfaces. Counterstaining of CTC-treated samples with the DNA-specific fluorochrome 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole allowed enumeration of active and total bacterial subpopulations within the same preparation. Municipal wastewater, groundwater, and seawater samples supplied with exogenous nutrients yielded CTC counts that were generally lower than total 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole counts but typically equal to or greater than standard heterotrophic (aerobic) plate counts. In unsupplemented water samples, CTC counts were typically lower than those obtained with the heterotrophic plate count method. Reduction of CTC by planktonic or biofilm-associated bacteria was suppressed by formaldehyde, presumably because of inhibition of electron transport activity and other metabolic processes. Because of their bright red fluorescence (emission maximum, 602 nm), actively respiring bacteria were readily distinguishable from abiotic particles and other background substances, which typically fluoresced at shorter wavelengths. The use of CTC greatly facilitated microscopic detection and enumeration of metabolically active (i.e., respiring) bacteria in environmental samples.},

Transcription of spoIVA is induced at about the second hour of sporulation by the regulatory protein sigma E from two closely spaced promoters designated P1 and P2. Experiments in which the upstream promoter P1 was removed show that transcription of spoIVA from P2 is sufficient for efficient spore formation.

Using a quantitative genetic approach. we study the joint evolution of a quantitative character determining performance in each habitat together with the changes in the population density. We find that specialization on a single habitat evolves with intermediate migration rates, whereas a generalist species evolves with both very low and very large rates of movement between habitats. There is a threshold at which a small increase in the connectivity of the two habitats will result in dramatic decrease in the total population size and the nearly complete loss of use of one of the two habitats through a process of "migrational meltdown." In some situations, equilibria corresponding to a specialist and a generalist species are simultaneously stable. Analysis of our model also shows cases of hysteresis in which small transient changes in the landscape structure or accidental demographic disturbances have irreversible effects on the evolution of specialization.},

abstract = {Untangling the influence of human activities on food-web stability and persistence is complex given the large numbers of species and overwhelming number of interactions within ecosystems. Although biodiversity has been associated with stability, the actual structures and processes that confer stability to diverse food webs remain largely unknown. Here we show that real food webs are structured such that top predators act as couplers of distinct energy channels that differ in both productivity and turnover rate. Our theoretical analysis shows that coupled fast and slow channels convey both local and non-local stability to food webs. Alarmingly, the same human actions that have been implicated in the loss of biodiversity also directly erode the very structures and processes that we show to confer stability on food webs.},

abstract = {We propose that islands are "less insular" than is generally perceived. This belief results. in part, from the paucity of studies on vagrant species that exploit islands but are not permanent residents with continual breeding populations. We show, via anecdotal evidence extracted from the literature and data acquired on Gulf of California islands, that visitors to insular systems are fairly common. We delineate three types of events beyond the bounds of current biogeographical analysis that make islands less insular: 1) migrants and 'accidental' visitors, 2) individuals of a species whose foraging areas encompass many islands or the mainland and islands. and 3) species who "colonize" islands during opportune periods or years but become extinct during difficult times (source-sink situations). Such events potentially significantly affect the ecology and evolution of island inhabitants by such means as increased predation and/or competition, transport of parasites and pathogens, dispersal of seeds and eggs, and genetic introgression and hybridization. Discussion of other "insular" habitats such as freshwater lakes and wildlife refuges illustrate that vagrancy events may be nearly ubiquitous. Studies addressing the frequency and ecological and evolutionary significance of vagrants are required, especially in light of recent and rapid extinctions on islands and the increasing fragmentation of habitats.},

Nevertheless, without using prior information about the origins of individuals, we identified six main genetic clusters, five of which correspond to major geographic regions, and subclusters that often correspond to individual populations. General agreement of genetic and predefined populations suggests that self-reported ancestry can facilitate assessments of epidemiological risks but does not obviate the need to use genetic information in genetic association studies.},

However, because of the counterevolution of the victim, the system may not become extinct. In fact, a steady-state proficiency exists because both the selective death rate due to exploitation and the beneficial mutation rate change as proficiency does. If the system is stable at this proficiency, it should persist indefinitely. This stable proficiency will persist despite long term changes in the phenotypes of predator and victim. It exists even after one adds group selection and any infinite number of other evolutionary pressures to the model. The addition of other pressures allows one to deduce that the equilibrium rate of evolution in the system is the net beneficial mutation rate and is therefore nearly zero. Because of this compromise which evolution forces them to achieve, predator and victim can always be improved upon; they therefore coevolve through the eons.},

abstract = {In the graphical theory of predation, Rosenzweig and MacArthur (1963) showed the importance of knowing the general shape of a line they termed the prey isocline. The prey isocline is drawn in a two-dimensional coordinate system where the abcissa is the density of the prey population and the ordinate is that of the predator population. In such a system, the prey isocline is the set of points at which the prey population just maintains its density . Rosenzweig and Mac Arthur justified rather weakly the humped shape of the prey isocline by assuming the continuity of biological preocesses. They argued that, since the prey cannot reproduce in the absence of predators required to prevent the prey from increasing must itself be diminishing tward zero. If so, at low prey densities the prey isocline has positive slope. The importance of determining whether such a segment of positive slope exists cannot be overemphasized. If the prey isocline has no such segment, the predation interaction´s equilibrium (whenever it exists) will be a locally stable one. In other words, if the isocline always has negative slope, minor environmental and random fluctuations will be counterbalanced by the interaction, and the predation will persist, never causing prey or predator extinction. Positive slope allows such extinction.},

The first step assumes habitat selection is density independent and free of search costs. The second assumes density independence, and the third assumes neither. The first two steps produce results already known from earlier theories. The third, however, requires a new analytical device, the isoleg, which is a line in a two—dimensional—state space of the two species' densities. An isoleg is a set of points in such a density space, such that on one side of the set, individuals of a species optimize their foraging by being strict habitat selectors, whereas on the other side, they do so by using at least a bit of a poorer patch. The population dynamics of the competitors is analyzed using their isolegs.

abstract = {The population dynamics of a general three-species, three-trophic-level exploitational system are explored. The conclusions pertaining to three levels are much the same as those for two. Exploitation is defined as one species using another to satisfy its reproductive requirements while the other suffers reproductive depression because of the interaction. Exploitation is the only interspecific interaction assumed to exist in the system. Other assumptions of the theory include: (a) it is possible to construct a first-order partial, nonlinear, differential equation for each species which will predict the population dynamics of that species (such equations do not exist today because of our ignorance); (b) carnivores exploit herbivores, herbivores exploit plants; (c) both herbivores and plants exhibit intraspecific competition at high densities and intraspecific mutualism at low densities. The mutualism may be only technical and requires only that the victim's predators exert a diminishing effect on each victim as victim population increases; (d) carnivores have no intraspecific interaction; (e) habitats are homogeneous in space and time; and (f) populations are phenotypically homogeneous. These assumptions are used to construct the general zero isoclines for each species. From linear approximations of the isoclines, one can determine dynamics near any possible community equilibria. For an equilibrium point to be stable, the plants' intraspecific competition must overshadow their mutualism near that equilibrium. If the same is true of herbivores, the equilibrium is a steady state. If not, it may still be a steady state, provided the herbivore mutualism is weak, herbivore and carnivore interactions are generally weak, and all plant interactions are strong. The population dynamics of the species may or may not exhibit oscillations. As in the two-species model, natural selection can destabilize the equilibrium. Addition of the third or carnivore species always increases the equilibrium density of plants. But its effect on herbivore density is not predictable without knowledge of the dynamics of the two-species system to which it is added. Addition of the carnivore may not only increase both plant and herbivore densities, it may also stabilize them. Thus, removal of carnivores is a perilous ecological gamble. Because of the nonlinear properties of an exploitative system, measurement of interaction coefficients in one small region of phase space does not yield information about stability in other regions.},

abstract = {Geostatistics brings to ecology novel tools for the interpretation of spatial patterns of organisms, of the numerous environmental components with which they in- teract, and of the joint spatial dependence between organisms and their environment. The purpose of this paper is to use data from the ecological literature as well as from original research to provide a comprehensive and easily understood analysis of geostatistics' manner of modeling and methods. The traditional geostatistical tool, the variogram, a tool that is beginning to be used in ecology, is shown to provide an incomplete and misleading summary of spatial pattern when local means and variances change. Use of the non-ergodic covariance and correlogram provides a more effective description of lag-to-lag spatial dependence because the changing local means and variances are accounted for. Indicator transforma- tions capture the spatial patterns of nominal ecological variables like gene frequencies and the presence/absence of an organism and of subgroups of a population like large or small individuals. Robust variogram measures are shown to be useful in data sets that contain many data outliers. Appropriate removal of outliers reveals latent spatial dependence and patterns. Cross-variograms, cross-covariances, and cross-correlograms define the joint spa- tial dependence between co-occurring organisms. The results of all of these analyses bring new insights into the spatial relations of organisms in their environment},

abstract = {The biological integrity of stream ecosystems depends critically on human activities that affect land usekover along stream margins and possibly throughout the catchment. We evaluated stream condition using an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) and a habitat index (HI), and compared these measures to landscape and riparian conditions assessed at different spatial scales in a largely agricultural Midwestern watershed. Our goal was to determine whether land usekover was an effective predictor of stream integrity, and if so, at what spatial scale. Twenty-three sites in first-through third-order headwater streams were surveyed by electrofishing and site IBIS were calculated based on ten metrics of the fish collection. Habitat features were characterized through field observation, and site HIS calculated from nine instream and bank metrics. Field surveys, aerial photograph interpretation, and geographic information system (GIS) analyses provided assessments of forested land and other vegetation covers at the local, reach, and regional (catchment) scales. The range of conditions among the 23 sites varied from poor to very good based on IBI and HI scores, and habitat and fish assemblage measures were highly correlated. Stream biotic integrity and habitat quality were negatively correlated with the extent of agriculture and positively correlated with extent of wetlands and forest. Correlations were strongest at the catchment scale (IBI with {\%} area as agriculture, r2 = 0.50, HI with agriculture, r2 = 0.76), and tended to become weak and non-significant at local scales. Local riparian vegetation was a weak secondary predictor of stream integrity. In this watershed, regional land use is the primary determinant of stream conditions, able to overwhelm the ability of local site vegetation to support high-quality habitat and biotic communities.},

abstract = {Streamflow from small watersheds on the western slopes of the Oregon Cascade Range is strongly influenced by a maritaime climate (wet winters and dry summers). Although annual precipitation is high (94 inches in the study area), overland flow is almost unknown. Peak flows result largely from subsurface flow and under conditions in which both retrention and detention reservoirs are almost filled during extended periods of low-intensity rainfall. Under these conditions, vegetation appears to exert a minimum influence on high streamflow. Lowest streamflow occurs from late August to mid-November and may follow 60- to 100-day period with little or no rain. The dense vegetation of this part of the Douglas-fir region appears to exert its major influence at such times. Removal of vegetation from only 30{\%} of a 250-acre waterhsed has caused a 123-28{\%} increase in minimum streamflow. On a 237-acre watershed on which 80{\%} of the trees were cut, the increase in low flow was 85{\%}.},

abstract = {Abstract Community ecology entered the 1970s with the belief that niche theory would supply a general theory of community structure. The lack of wide-spread empirical support for niche theory led to a focus on models specific to classes of communities such as lakes, intertidal communities, and forests. Today, the needs of conservation biology for metrics of “ecological health” that can be applied across types of communities prompts a renewed interest in the possibility of general theory for community ecology. Disputes about the existence of general patterns in community structure trace at least to the 1920s and continue today almost unchanged in concept, although now expressed through mathematical modeling. Yet, a new framework emerged in the 1980s from findings that community composition and structure depend as much on the processes that bring species to the boundaries of a community as by processes internal to a community, such as species interactions and co-evolution. This perspective, termed “supply-side ecology”, argued that community ecology was to be viewed as an “organic earth science” more than as a biological science. The absence of a general theory of the earth would then imply a corresponding absence of any general theory for the communities on the earth, and imply that the logical structure of theoretical community ecology would consist of an atlas of models special to place and geologic time. Nonetheless, a general theory of community ecology is possible similar in form to the general theory for evolution if the processes that bring species to the boundary of a community are analogized to mutation, and the processes that act on the species that arrive at a community are analogized to selection. All communities then share some version of this common narrative, permitting general theorems to be developed pertaining to all ecological communities. Still, the desirability of a general theory of community ecology is debatable because the existence of a general theory suppresses diversity of thought even as it allows generalizations to be derived. The pros and cons of a general theory need further discussion.},

abstract = {In spatially heterogeneous landscapes, some habitats may be persistent sources, providing immigrants to sustain populations in unfavorable sink habitats (where extinction is inevitable without immigration). Recent theoretical and empirical studies of source-sink systems demonstrate that temporally variable local growth rates in sinks can substantially increase average abundance of a persisting population, provided that the variation is positively autocorrelated--in effect, temporal variation inflates average abundance. Here we extend these results to a metapopulation in which all habitat patches are sinks. Using numerical studies of a population with discrete generations (buttressed by analytic results), we show that temporal variation and moderate dispersal can jointly permit indefinite persistence of the metapopulation and that positive autocorrelation both lowers the magnitude of variation required for persistence and increases the average abundance of persisting metapopulations. These effects are weakened--but not destroyed--if variation in local growth rates is spatially synchronized and dispersal is localized. We show that the inflationary effect is robust to a number of extensions of the basic model, including demographic stochasticity and density dependence. Because ecological and environmental processes contributing to temporally variable growth rates in natural populations are typically autocorrelated, these observations may have important implications for species persistence.},

abstract = {1,10 Westernization has propelled changes in urbanization and architecture, altering our exposure to the outdoor environment from that experienced during most of human evolution. These changes might affect the develop-mental exposure of infants to bacteria, immune development, and human microbiome diversity. Contemporary urban humans spend most of their time indoors, and little is known about the microbes associated with different designs of the built environment and their interaction with the human immune system. This study addresses the associations between architectural design and the microbial biogeography of households across a gradient of urbanization in South America. Urbanization was associated with households' increased isolation from outdoor environments, with additional indoor space isolation by walls. Microbes from house walls and floors segregate by location, and urban indoor walls contain human bacterial markers of space use. Urbanized spaces uniquely in-crease the content of human-associated microbes—which could increase transmission of potential pathogens— and decrease exposure to the environmental microbes with which humans have coevolved.},

abstract = {Adaptive consumer movement and between-patch heterogeneity have both been suggested to reduce population fluctuations in spatially subdivided systems. These conjectures are explored using models of two-patch consumer-resource systems with fitness dependent consumer movement and cyclic dynamics in at least one of the patches; neither conjecture applies generally to such systems. Under relatively low heterogeneity, highly accurate and rapid adaptive movement most often increases both the between-patch correlation of density and the variation in the total density of both species compared to a similar system having a low rate of random movement. However, such adaptive movement can decrease between-patch correlation and global population variability when (1) the consumer's movement is moderately sensitive to fitness differences and heterogeneity is relatively low, or (2) one of the patches would be stable in isolation, and the stable patch supports a sufficiently large consumer population. In both cases, the dynamics are typically either a stable equilibrium or a simple anti-phase cycle with low variation in total population size. Under adaptive movement, population variability is often lowest for intermediate levels of heterogeneity, but monotonic increases or decreases with increasing spatial heterogeneity are possible, depending on the fitness sensitivity of movement and how the characteristic that differs between patches affects within-patch stability and population size. High rates of random movement can lead to greater stability than adaptive movement when consumers are very efficient. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The species–area relationship (SAR) has been used to predict the numbers of species going extinct due to habitat loss, but other researchers have maintained that SARs overestimate extinctions and instead one should use the endemics–area relationship (EAR) to predict extinctions. Here, we employ spatially explicit simulations of large numbers of species in spatially heterogeneous landscapes to investigate SARs and extinctions in a dynamic context. The EAR gives the number of species going extinct immediately after habitat loss, but typically many other species have unviable populations in the remaining habitat and go extinct soon afterwards. We conclude that the EAR underestimates extinctions due to habitat loss, the continental SAR (with slope {\~{}}0.1 or somewhat less) gives a good approximation of short-term extinctions, while the island SAR calculated for discrete fragments of habitat (with slope {\~{}}0.25) predicts the long-term extinctions. However, when the remaining area of land-covering habitat such as forest is roughly less than 20{\%} of the total landscape and the habitat is highly fragmented, all current SARs underestimate extinction rate. We show how the ‘fragmentation effect' can be incorporated into a predictive SAR model. When the remaining habitat is highly fragmented, an effective way to combat the fragmentation effect is to aggregate habitat fragments into clusters rather than to place them randomly across the landscape.},

The role of environmental filtering can be investigated more directly by analysing community-environment associations, but dispersal limitation is one of the most challenging processes to examine. We investigated the role of traits related to dispersal - flight capacity, body size and voltinism - as drivers ofphylogenetic distance decay relationships in Neotropical stream insect communities.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nLocation Headwater streams spread over 600km in south-eastern Brazil.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMethods We compiled a data set of aquatic insect communities inhabiting streams across the State of SAo Paulo (Brazil). Then, we investigated environmental and spatial signals on phylobetadiversity patterns of aquatic insects using Mantel tests, multiple regressions on distance matrices and variation partitioning. We employed null models to investigate whether phylogenetic distance decay differed from pure compositional distance decay. We deconstructed the data set based on dispersal-related traits; we then ran distance decay analyses for these subsets separately.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nResults Geographical distance, rather than environmental distance, better explained the patterns of phylobetadiversity.

We suggest that life-history strategies and mainly voltinism drive the distance decay of similarity in the insect communities examined. We additionally discuss the role of dispersal events over time to explain differences in distance decay patterns among tropical and other regions.},

abstract = {We investigated expression of genes mediating elemental cycling at the microspatial scale in the ocean's largest river plume using, to our knowledge, the first fully quantitative inventory of genes and transcripts. The bacterial and archaeal communities associated with a phytoplankton bloom in Amazon River Plume waters at the outer continental shelf in June 2010 harbored ∼ 1.0 × 10(13) genes and 4.7 × 10(11) transcripts per liter that mapped to several thousand microbial genomes. Genomes from free-living cells were more abundant than those from particle-associated cells, and they generated more transcripts per liter for carbon fixation, heterotrophy, nitrogen and phosphorus uptake, and iron acquisition, although they had lower expression ratios (transcripts ⋅ gene(-1)) overall. Genomes from particle-associated cells contributed more transcripts for sulfur cycling, aromatic compound degradation, and the synthesis of biologically essential vitamins, with an overall twofold up-regulation of expression compared with free-living cells. Quantitatively, gene regulation differences were more important than genome abundance differences in explaining why microenvironment transcriptomes differed. Taxa contributing genomes to both free-living and particle-associated communities had up to 65{\%} of their expressed genes regulated differently between the two, quantifying the extent of transcriptional plasticity in marine microbes in situ. In response to patchiness in carbon, nutrients, and light at the micrometer scale, Amazon Plume microbes regulated the expression of genes relevant to biogeochemical processes at the ecosystem scale.},

In particular, we study the effects of noise on the invariant measure, on the "correlation" dimension of the attractor, and on the possibility of detecting the nonlinear deterministic component by applying reconstruction techniques to the time series of population abundances. We conclude that adding noise to maps with a stable fixed-point obscures the underlying determinism. This turns out not to be the case for systems exhibiting complex periodic or chaotic motion, whose essential properties are more robust. In some cases, adding noise reveals deterministic structure which otherwise could not be observed. Simulations suggest that similar results hold for flows whose attractor is almost two- dimensional.},

Evolution among the predators acts to displace the predators' zero growth isocline, j, to the left, whereas victim evolution has the opposite effect. More important, we show that for many such systems, there is a value of J, I*, at which the rate of predator evolution exactly equals the rate of victim evolution. This value of J turns out to be a coevolutionary steady state (CSS) which is stable to perturbations. It is suggested that this analysis permits qualitative understanding of why certain real world predator-prey systems oscillate, whereas others do not.},

abstract = {Ecological resilience is the ability of a system to persist in the face of per- turbations. Although resilience has been a highly influential concept, its interpretation has remained largely qualitative. Here we describe an emerg- ing family of methods for quantifying resilience on the basis of observations. A first set of methods is based on the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which implies that recovery upon small perturbations becomes slower as a system approaches a tipping point. Such slowing down can be measured experimentally but may also be indirectly inferred from changes in natu- ral fluctuations and spatial patterns. A second group of methods aims to characterize the resilience of alternative states in probabilistic terms based on large numbers of observations as in long time series or satellite images. These generic approaches to measuring resilience complement the system- specific knowledge needed to infer the effects of environmental change on the resilience of complex systems.},

abstract = {All ecosystems are exposed to gradual changes in climate, nutrient loading, habitat fragmentation or biotic exploitation. Nature is usually assumed to respond to gradual change in a smooth way. However, studies on lakes, coral reefs, oceans, forests and arid lands have shown that smooth change can be interrupted by sudden drastic switches to a contrasting state. Although diverse events can trigger such shifts, recent studies show that a loss of resilience usually paves the way for a switch to an alternative state. This suggests that strategies for sustainable management of such ecosystems should focus on maintaining resilience.},

Dark, anoxic conditions under thick floating-plant cover leave little opportunity for animal or plant life, and they can have large negative impacts on fisheries and navigation in tropical lakes. Here, we demonstrate that floating-plant dominance can be a self-stabilizing ecosystem state, which may explain its notorious persistence in many situations. Our results, based on experiments, field data, and models, represent evidence for alternative domains of attraction in ecosystems. An implication of our findings is that nutrient enrichment reduces the resilience of freshwater systems against a shift to floating-plant dominance. On the other hand, our results also suggest that a single drastic harvest of floating plants can induce a permanent shift to an alternative state dominated by rooted, submerged growth forms.},

For studies that included tropical regions, biotic interactions were never more important at high latitudes. Although our re- sults support the hypothesis that biotic interactions are more important in the tropics, additional research is needed, including latitudinal comparisons of rates of molecular evolution for genes involved in biotic interactions, es- timates of gradients in interaction strength, and phylogenetic comparisons of the traits that mediate biotic interactions.},

abstract = {Water scarcity severely impairs food security and economic prosperity in many countries today. Expected future population changes will, in many countries as well as globally, increase the pressure on available water resources. On the supply side, renewable water resources will be affected by projected changes in precipitation patterns, temperature, and other climate variables. Here we use a large ensemble of global hydrological models (GHMs) forced by five global climate models and the latest greenhouse-gas concentration scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways) to synthesize the current knowledge about climate change impacts on water resources. We show that climate change is likely to exacerbate regional and global water scarcity considerably. In particular, the ensemble average projects that a global warming of 2 °C above present (approximately 2.7 °C above preindustrial) will confront an additional approximate 15{\%} of the global population with a severe decrease in water resources and will increase the number of people living under absolute water scarcity ({\textless}500 m(3) per capita per year) by another 40{\%} (according to some models, more than 100{\%}) compared with the effect of population growth alone. For some indicators of moderate impacts, the steepest increase is seen between the present day and 2 °C, whereas indicators of very severe impacts increase unabated beyond 2 °C. At the same time, the study highlights large uncertainties associated with these estimates, with both global climate models and GHMs contributing to the spread. GHM uncertainty is particularly dominant in many regions affected by declining water resources, suggesting a high potential for improved water resource projections through hydrological model development.},

abstract = {Trophic cascades are textbook examples of predator indirect effects on ecological systems. Yet there is considerable debate about their nature, strength and overall importance. This debate stems in part from continued uncertainty about the ultimate mechanisms driving cascading effects. We present a synthesis of empirical evidence in support of one possible ultimate mechanism: the foraging-predation risk trade-offs undertaken by intermediary species. We show that simple trade-off behaviour can lead to both positive and negative indirect effects of predators on plant resources and hence can explain considerable contingency on the nature and strength of cascading effects among systems. Thus, predicting the sign and strength of indirect effect simply requires knowledge of habitat and resource use by prey with regard to predators? presence, habitat use and hunting mode. The synthesis allows us to postulate a hypothesis for new conceptualization of trophic cascades which is to be viewed as an ultimate trade-off between intervening species. In this context, different predators apply different rules of engagement based on their hunting mode and habitat use. These different rules then determine whether behavioural effects persist or attenuate at the level of the food chain.},

abstract = {This study analyzes extinction patterns for two species of orb spiders monitored annually on 77 islands over a continuous 20-yr period. One species, Argiope argentata, has large populations sometimes crashing quickly to extinction and a much weaker relation of extinction likelihood to population size than does the other species, Metepeira datona. Demographic models were built for both species and matched against observations. Differences between the species in life-history traits-estimated with measurements from the field-together with incorporation of demographic stochasticity, a population ceiling, and environmental stochasticity, were necessary to fit the observed extinction curves. As predicted from life-history patterns, long-term population growth rates (and hence predicted extinction probabilities) are relatively very sensitive to values of juvenile survivorship. Models are also sensitive to variation in the population ceiling and environmental noise, which tend to act in a complementary manner. A simple model with no age structure was able to fit the data on large initial population sizes but not on small initial population sizes, showing that life cycle characteristics interact with the various sources of stochasticity and hence have to be taken into account to produce a precise model of the extinction process.},

We determined a key population trait-survival-in the Bahamian lizard Anolis sagrei on islands with an experimentally introduced predatory lizard and on neighboring unmanipulated islands. On unmanipulated islands, survival declined with several variables, most notably vegetation height: The island with the shortest vegetation had nearly the highest survival recorded for any lizard. On islands with the introduced predator, which forages mostly on the ground, A. sagrei shifted to taller vegetation; unlike on unmanipulated islands, its survival was very low on islands with the shortest vegetation but was higher on the others. Thus, species introduction radically changed a resident species' relation of survival to a key island-biogeographical variable.},

abstract = {To understand resource partitioning, essentially a community phenomenon, we require a holistic theory that draws upon models at the individual and population level. Yet some investigators are still content mainly to document differences between species, a procedure of only limited interest. Therefore, it may be useful to conclude with a list of questions appropriate for studies of resource partitioning, questions this article has related to the theory in a preliminary way. 1) What is the mechanism of competition? What is the relative importance of predation? Are differences likely to be caused by pressures toward reproductive isolation? 2) Are niches (utilizations) regularly spaced along a single dimension? 3) How many dimensions are important, and is there a tendency for more dimensions to be added as species number increases? 4) Is dimensional separation complementary? 5) Which dimensions are utilized, how do they rank in importance, and why? How do particular dimensions change in rank as species nuimber increases? 6) What is the relation of dimensional separation to difference in phenotypic indicators? To what extent does the functional relation of phenotype to resource characteristics constrain partitioning? 7) What is the distance between mean position of niches, what is the niche standard deviation, and what is the ratio of the two? What is the niche shape?},

abstract = {Sympatric native Anolis species with similar structural habitats but contrasting climatic habitats are closer in head and body size on species-rich than on depauperate islands. In two localities, sympatric Anolis species with differential occurrences in sun or shade sought lower, more shaded perches during midday, resulting in partly nonsynchronous utilization of the vegetation by the two species. The second observation may be related to the first in the following way: nonsynchronous spatial overlap could dictate relatively great resource overlap for species coinhabiting patchy or edge areas, requiring great differences between the species in prey size in addition to those in climatic habitat. The extent of such overlap on small depauperate islands could be greater if these contained a greater proportion of patchy or edge habitats (with respect to insolation), or if climatic preferences were broader and more overlapping than on large, species-rich islands. In each locality, the relatively more shade-inhabiting species occurred more often on larger perches and on lower perches than did the other species. In both species of the Bermudan pair, adult males occupied higher and larger perches, and in grahami, shadier perches, than did female-sized individuals. The statistical significance of these and other differences was evaluated using several unweighted @g{\^{}}2 procedures, Cochran's weighted @g{\^{}}2 test and a partitioning technique for analyzing interactions among variables in complex contingency tables. The last method is described in detail in the papaer by Fienberg, immediately following this one.},

abstract = {Contingency models of feeding compare the energy per unit time gained from utilizing a resource unit of a particular kind (food types, habitat patches, time periods) against that energy/time expected if the unit is skipped. Optimally, an animal should reject the particular unit if and only if the former energy/time is less than the latter. Consequently, food or habitat types should be excluded if the prospect of finding and consuming better types is sufficiently high. In contrast, feeding periods should be skipped only if it is less costly to wait than to feed.In situations of high food abundance, contingency models imply that animals should be maximally specialized with respect to food or habitat type, but maximally generalized with respect to time period. As food decreases in abundance, food and habitat types should be added to the diet or itinerary, but time periods should be omitted from feeding activity. In contrast, animals with fixed caloric intake should broaden diet, habitat, and feeding times as abundance decreases.According to contingency models, competitors cannot cause item kinds to be dropped from the diet, but because they can affect the values of patches once found, can cause habitat kinds to be dropped from the itinerary. Competitors also reduct the value of feeding during particular time periods, but ordinarily fairly severe depletion must occur before it is optimal to feed no longer in a period frequented by competitors.These arguments imply that temporal resource partitioning on a diel basis should be relatively rare. In fact, specialization according to feeding period should differentially occur in animals of limited abilities to use or process available food, whereas that need not be the case for food-type or habitat specialization. It should also occur in animals sensitive to and found in variable climates.},

This suggests the reasonable but largely untested idea that predation is less important as a determinant of population structure on small islands than on large islands or mainlands, particularly for relatively large potential prey such as songbirds and lizards3–10. We have compared the survival of three species of the lizard Anolis on two islands differing in size and number of predatory bird species. We report here that annual survival in sites identical in diurnal lizard species and nearly so in vegetation structure is smaller, and usually substantially so, on the larger island. In one species, the size distribution of males parallels this difference in survival: lizards are smaller where survival is lower. Sexual differences in survival between the two islands are especially marked in an intensely territorial, polygamous species.},

This might seem to imply that most populations are ephemeral, but {\~{}}50{\%} of the populations present in the system at any one time are persistent over at least the moderately long term. Curves of persistence through time for ensembles of populations are more concave than exponential curves, indicating highest extinction rates in young populations; species vary greatly in the slope of this population 'persistence curve'. In any one-year period, small populations become extinct much more frequently than larger populations. Over longer periods, however, larger populations do not diminish and become extinct; instead, smaller populations re-immigrate and become extinct repeatedly. The total number of individuals belonging to populations becoming extinct during intervals of up to five years is small compared to those persisting. Thus, a layer of small, ephemeral populations is superimposed against a backdrop of large, persistent populations.},

Here we investigate how predator introduction affects one aspect of prey diversity (number of species or species richness), and prey abundance, We ran a seven-year experiment on an entirely natural system of small islands, using the commonest local lizard as the predator and web spiders as prey. Lizard introduction caused rapid and devastating effects on spider diversity and abundance: within two years, islands onto which lizards had been introduced became almost identical to islands with natural lizard populations. The proportion of species becoming extinct was 12.6 times higher on 'lizard-introduction' islands than on islands without lizards. Locally common and rare species were both reduced by the introduction of lizards, but nearly all of the latter became permanently extinct.},

abstract = {There has been considerable research on both top-down effects and on disturbances in ecological communities; however, the interaction between the two, when the disturbance is catastrophic, has rarely been examined. Predators may increase the probability of prey extinction resulting from a catastrophic disturbance both by reducing prey population size and by changing ecological traits of prey individuals such as habitat characteristics in a way that increases the vulnerability of prey species to extinction. We show that a major hurricane in the Bahamas led to the extinction of lizard populations on most islands onto which a predator had been experimentally introduced, whereas no populations became extinct on control islands. Before the hurricane, the predator had reduced prey populations to about half of those on control islands. Two months after the hurricane, we found only recently hatched individuals--apparently lizards survived the inundating storm surge only as eggs. On predator-introduction islands, those hatchling populations were a smaller fraction of pre-hurricane populations than on control islands. Egg survival allowed rapid recovery of prey populations to pre-hurricane levels on all control islands but on only a third of predator-introduction islands--the other two-thirds lost their prey populations. Thus climatic disturbance compounded by predation brought prey populations to extinction.},

abstract = {For animal species inhabiting patchy environments, the search behavior of individuals and the distance from which they can detect suitable habitat (perceptual range) are key determinants of the functional connectivity of landscapes. We examined the movement behavior and perceptual range of adult cactus bugs (Chelinidea vittiger), which are habitat specialists that feed and reproduce on Opuntia cactus. Movement pathways of walking individuals released into unsuitable matrix habitat (30-3000 m from Opuntia) were highly directional. These results supported predictions of optimal search behavior from published simulation models. A release experiment within natural patch networks indicated that the perceptual range of C. vittiger depended on size of the target patch, matrix structure, and direction of the target patch relative to prevailing winds. A strong effect of wind direction on orientation behavior (and presumed perceptual range) was evident in a release experiment using 'artificial' patches of potted Opuntia. In these two experiments, individuals released 50-100 cm from Opuntia patches were more likely to orientate toward patches located upwind than to those located crosswind or downwind. A reexamination of the pathways of individuals walking in the matrix also revealed a strong bias for movement upwind. Such upwind movement by individuals, both within and outside of patch networks, suggests that C. vittiger uses olfaction to navigate and it complicates our ability to interpret search behavior and to estimate perceptual range. Current techniques for assessing perceptual range have limitations for olfactory-based species. Furthermore, we need to broaden our view of perceptual range and of patch and landscape connectivity. Perceptual range may be anisotropic and connectivity may be directional. An organism-based approach to spatial ecology requires that we consider the dominant senses used by species when navigating around patchy landscapes.},

abstract = {The ability of a species to invade a community is influenced by the traits of the invader, the resident community and the environment. However, qualitative generalizations are possible. Using a model of perennial plants in a spatiotemporally fluctuating environment, we find that fluctuating environments may be more or less invasible than static environments. Invasibility is strongly dependent on the interaction of the difference in turnover rates of resident and invader populations and the rate of temporal change of the environment. If resident population turnover is faster than the invader's, then invasibility is an initially positive, decreasing function of the period temporal variation, such that invasibility is increased by rapid temporal fluctuations but slightly reduced in slowly fluctuating environments. If resident turnover is slower than the invader's, then invasibility is an initially negative, increasing function of temporal period, such that invasibility is reduced in rapidly changing environment facilitated by slow temporal fluctuations. These results are explained by the relative abilities of resident and invader populations to successfully respond to environmental variation at different temporal scales.},

The arthropod fauna was dominated in terms of densities by psyllids and aphids on snowbrush and by adelgids and cecidomyiids on Douglas-fir. Significant associations among taxa, e.g., positive correlation between aphids and ants, indicated trophic interactions or similar responses to host conditions. Significant seasonality was observed for individual taxa and for the community, reflecting the integration of individual life-history patterns. Significant spatial pattern (patchiness) in the arthropod community may reflect the influence of faunas on individual plants within neighborhoods and/or the influence of ant foraging patterns.},

A better understanding of how human activities affect source-sink dynamics has the potential to inform and improve the management of species of conservation concern. Here we use a study of the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) to introduce new methods for quantifying source-sink dynamics that simultaneously describe the population-wide consequences of changes to landscape connectivity. Our spotted owl model is mechanistic, spatially-explicit, individual-based, and incorporates competition with barred owls (Strix varia). Our observations of spotted owl source-sink dynamics could not have been inferred solely from habitat quality, and were sensitive to landscape connectivity and the spatial sampling schemes employed by the model. We conclude that a clear understanding of source-sink dynamics can best be obtained from sampling simultaneously at multiple spatial scales. Our methodology is general, can be readily adapted to other systems, and will work with population models ranging from simple and low-parameter to complex and data-intensive.},

Our results thus indicate that mussel distribution is more closely linked to host fish for high-dispersal mussels, which suggests the potential for species sorting. Mussel species with weak dispersal capabilities show the opposite pattern and are therefore less able to colonise all suitable sites (species sorting with limited dispersal). Thus, the absence of mussels does not necessarily indicate unsuitable environmental conditions, but can also be caused by dispersal limitation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* The impact of different host infection strategies was less clear, and differences in responses could be driven by differences in host fish or even habitat specialisation in addition to potential differences in dispersal abilities.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* A better knowledge of the dispersal via host fish of unionid mussels and their host infection strategies will be crucial to understanding their metacommunity dynamics, a necessary precursor for effective conservation practices.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Recent theory supports the long-held proposition that coexistence is promoted by species-specific responses to a spatially varying environment. The underlying coexistence mechanism, the spatial storage effect, can be quantified by the covariance between response to the environment and competition. Here, "competition" is generalized to encompass similar processes such as facilitation and apparent competition. In the present study, we use a model field system of desert annual plants to demonstrate this method and to provide insight into the dynamics of the field system. Specifically, we use neighborhood competition experiments to quantify the spatial storage effect and compare it to the separate (but not mutually exclusive) process of neighborhood-scale resource partitioning. As our basic experimental design has been used frequently in community ecology, these methods can be applied to many existing data sets, as well as future field studies.},

abstract = {Urban land-cover change threatens biodiversity and affects ecosystem productivity through loss of habitat, biomass, and carbon storage. However, despite projections that world urban populations will increase to nearly 5 billion by 2030, little is known about future locations, magnitudes, and rates of urban expansion. Here we develop spatially explicit probabilistic forecasts of global urban land-cover change and explore the direct impacts on biodiversity hotspots and tropical carbon biomass. If current trends in population density continue and all areas with high probabilities of urban expansion undergo change, then by 2030, urban land cover will increase by 1.2 million km(2), nearly tripling the global urban land area circa 2000. This increase would result in considerable loss of habitats in key biodiversity hotspots, with the highest rates of forecasted urban growth to take place in regions that were relatively undisturbed by urban development in 2000: the Eastern Afromontane, the Guinean Forests of West Africa, and the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka hotspots. Within the pan-tropics, loss in vegetation biomass from areas with high probability of urban expansion is estimated to be 1.38 PgC (0.05 PgC yr(-1)), equal to ∼5{\%} of emissions from tropical deforestation and land-use change. Although urbanization is often considered a local issue, the aggregate global impacts of projected urban expansion will require significant policy changes to affect future growth trajectories to minimize global biodiversity and vegetation carbon losses.},

abstract = {Microbial communities typically contain many rare taxa that make up the majority of the observed membership, yet the contribution of this microbial "rare biosphere" to community dynamics is unclear. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of 3,237 samples from 42 time series of microbial communities from nine different ecosystems (air; marine; lake; stream; adult human skin, tongue, and gut; infant gut; and brewery wastewater treatment), we introduce a new method to detect typically rare microbial taxa that occasionally become very abundant (conditionally rare taxa [CRT]) and then quantify their contributions to temporal shifts in community structure. We discovered that CRT made up 1.5 to 28{\%} of the community membership, represented a broad diversity of bacterial and archaeal lineages, and explained large amounts of temporal community dissimilarity (i.e., up to 97{\%} of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity). Most of the CRT were detected at multiple time points, though we also identified "one-hit wonder" CRT that were observed at only one time point. Using a case study from a temperate lake, we gained additional insights into the ecology of CRT by comparing routine community time series to large disturbance events. Our results reveal that many rare taxa contribute a greater amount to microbial community dynamics than is apparent from their low proportional abundances. This observation was true across a wide range of ecosystems, indicating that these rare taxa are essential for understanding community changes over time. Importance: Microbial communities and their processes are the foundations of ecosystems. The ecological roles of rare microorganisms are largely unknown, but it is thought that they contribute to community stability by acting as a reservoir that can rapidly respond to environmental changes. We investigated the occurrence of typically rare taxa that very occasionally become more prominent in their communities ("conditionally rare"). We quantified conditionally rare taxa in time series from a wide variety of ecosystems and discovered that not only were conditionally rare taxa present in all of the examples, but they also contributed disproportionately to temporal changes in diversity when they were most abundant. This result indicates an important and general role for rare microbial taxa within their communities.},

abstract = {Genetic exchange is common among bacteria, but its effect on population diversity during ecological differentiation remains controversial. A fundamental question is whether advantageous mutations lead to selection of clonal genomes or, as in sexual eukaryotes, sweep through populations on their own. Here, we show that in two recently diverged populations of ocean bacteria, ecological differentiation has occurred akin to a sexual mechanism: A few genome regions have swept through subpopulations in a habitat-specific manner, accompanied by gradual separation of gene pools as evidenced by increased habitat specificity of the most recent recombinations. These findings reconcile previous, seemingly contradictory empirical observations of the genetic structure of bacterial populations and point to a more unified process of differentiation in bacteria and sexual eukaryotes than previously thought.},

abstract = {We propose that microbial diversity must be viewed in light of gene flow and selection, which define units of genetic similarity, and of phenotype and ecological function, respectively. We discuss to what extent ecological and genetic units overlap to form cohesive populations in the wild, based on recent evolutionary modeling and on evidence from some of the first microbial populations studied with genomics. These show that if recombination is frequent and selection moderate, ecologically adaptive mutations or genes can spread within populations independently of their original genomic background (gene-specific sweeps). Alternatively, if the effect of recombination is smaller than selection, genome-wide selective sweeps should occur. In both cases, however, distinct units of overlapping ecological and genotypic similarity will form if microgeographic separation, likely involving ecological tradeoffs, induces barriers to gene flow. These predictions are supported by (meta)genomic data, which suggest that a 'reverse ecology' approach, in which genomic and gene flow information is used to make predictions about the nature of ecological units, is a powerful approach to ordering microbial diversity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Community ecology theory can be used to understand biological invasions by applying recent niche concepts to alien species and the communities that they invade. These ideas lead to the concept of 'niche opportunity', which defines conditions that promote invasions in terms of resources, natural enemies, the physical environment, interactions between these factors, and the manner in which they vary in time and space. Niche opportunities vary naturally between communities but might be greatly increased by disruption of communities, especially if the original community members are less well adapted to the new conditions. Recent niche theory clarifies the prediction that low niche opportunities (invasion resistance) result from high species diversity. Conflicting empirical patterns of invasion resistance are potentially explained by covarying external factors. These various ideas derived from community ecology provide a predictive framework for invasion ecology.},

abstract = {The extent to which ecological communities are coherent entities as opposed to mere intersections of individual species distributions has long been one of the fundamental questions of ecology. Gradient analysis is one commonly used tool for addressing this question; however, all such studies have used organisms from a single taxon or guild. This risks missing important connections due to non-competitive interactions, which should be more likely to occur between members of different guilds. Such organisms are unlikely to compete for resources and can have complementary niches that promote non-competitive interactions. We examined the abundances of taxa in four interacting guilds along an elevation gradient in a forest in the southern Appalachian mountains. A causal discovery algorithm was used to investigate the relative frequencies of interguild and intraguild interactions. These were approximately equally common once taxonomic richness was taken into account. We used elements of metacommunity structure analysis to study the extent to which species distributions are non-independent and tested the hypothesis that combinations of two or more interacting guilds exhibit more coherence than single guilds. In this analysis, all guilds other than collembola were classified as Clementsian or quasi-Clementsian. (Collembola were classified as random.) When sets of multiple guilds were examined, Clementsian and quasi-Clementsian structures predominated. We also compared boundary conjunction, measured as Morisita's index (MI) for these sets of guilds to the weighted average of the guilds' MI values. Only sets of directly interacting guilds had higher-than-baseline boundary conjunction values, and such boundary conjunction values are found in all but one set of directly interacting guilds. Our results highlight the importance of inter-guild interactions in structuring patterns of cooccurrence. Trophic interactions and plant–fungus symbioses (mutualistic and/or pathogen–host) appear particularly important.},

Here, we extend Shipley's maxent model (Community Assembly by Trait Selection, CATS) for the prediction of relative abundances to incorporate both trait-based filtering and dispersal limitation from the larger landscape and develop a statistical decomposition of the proportions of the total information content of relative abundances in local communities that are attributable to trait-based filtering, dispersal limitation, and demographic stochasticity. We apply the method to tree communities in a mature, species-rich, tropical forest in French Guiana at 1-, 0.25- and 0.04-ha scales. Trait data consisted of species' means of 17 functional traits measured over both the entire meta-community and separately in each of nine 1-ha plots. Trait means calculated separately for each site always gave better predictions. There was clear evidence of trait-based filtering at all spatial scales. Trait-based filtering was the most important process at the 1-ha scale (34{\%}), whereas demographic stochasticity was the most important at smaller scales (37–53{\%}). Dispersal limitation from the meta-community was less important and approximately constant across scales (9{\%}), and there was also an unresolved association between site-specific traits and meta-community relative abundances. Our method allows one to quantify the relative importance of local niche-based and meta-community processes and demographic stochasticity during community assembly across spatial and temporal scales.},

Here, we draw on recent mechanistic ecological studies to argue that, in addition to altered habitat structure, three major processes contribute to the patterns of reduced species diversity and elevated abundance of many species in urban environments. These activities, in turn, lead to changes in animal behavior, morphology and genetics, as well as in selection pressures on animals and plants. Thus, the key to understanding urban patterns is to balance studying processes at the individual level with an integrated examination of environmental forces at the ecosystem scale. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Pine (Pinus ponderosa) was processed much more slowly. The loss rate coefficient (k) ranged from .0038 for pine to .0308 for alder. The high biomass of shredders per gram of leaf pack is a likely explanation for the rapid processing. Whereas a few large shredders per leaf pack are generally characteristic of eastern woodland streams, a large number of small-sized shredders (Capnia and Zapada) colonized leaf packs in the Colorado mountain stream. The numbers and biomass of collectors per leaf pack were directly related (P {\textless} .01) to the ash-free dry mass of fine organic particles (75-1000 @mm) indicating the importance of fine particulate organic matter in determining the suitability of leaf litter as habitat for fine particle-feeding detritivores.

We develop a model that draws on elements of metapopulation models of competitors and food chains by allowing competitors to coexist locally in the presence of predators but not in their absence. The model predicts that predators promote regional coexistence by greatly expanding the range of conditions under which two competitors persist at equilibrium. Predators could have positive or negative effects on mean local diversity within the region depending on their dispersal rates, those of the prey, and their effects on prey extinction rates. The presence of predators increased the abundance of inferior competitors, thereby expanding the conditions for positive relationships between local and regional diversity. The model also predicted positive correlations between local diversity of predators and prey. These predictions were supported by patterns of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish species richness among lakes. The model may help to resolve the apparent contrast between linear patterns of local and regional richness and experimental evidence for strong invasion resistance and rapid dispersal in zooplankton.},

abstract = {Assemblages of coexisting species are formed by immigration from a regional pool of colonists and local interactions among species and with the physical environment. Theory suggests that the shape of the relationship between regional and local species richness may indicate the relative roles of dispersal and local interactions in limiting local diversity. Here we examine patterns of regional and local species richness in freshwater crustacean zooplankton to test whether linear (suggesting dispersal limitation) or curvilinear (suggesting saturation, via strong local control) functions best fit the data, Local richness appeared saturated when regions of different spatial extents were included on the same graph, However, this pattern was influenced by differences in scale among surveys. We corrected for the effects of regional scale by plotting mean local richness against the residuals of the species-landscape area relations. Controlling for the extent of the regional scale produced much more linear patterns, suggesting strong dispersal limitation, We present a simple graphical model to explain how variation among surveys in the geographic size of regions can produce apparent saturation of local diversity even if the underlying pattern of local and regional richness is linear. We also compare the predictive power of residual regional richness on local richness with that of several local features in a multiple regression model. Local richness exhibits strong relationships with both residual regional richness and pH. We argue that the relative strengths of local and regional processes depend on the definition of the regional scale. A variety of evidence suggests that local processes play a major role in generating differences in zooplankton diversity among lakes within a biogeographic region. Evidence for the importance of dispersal limitation comes largely from comparisons of lakes across very large scales. Our analysis suggests that linear patterns of local and regional diversity are not incompatible with strong local interactions},

The existence of refuges can clearly have important effects on the coexistence of predators and prey. Previous models have only considered the effects of a constant proportion or constant number of prey using refuges. However, these are only two special cases from among the range of possible patterns of refuge use. We show the general conditions for when refuge use should have a stabilizing effect on Lotka-Volterra-type predator-prey systems. For a stabilizing effect, the proportion of prey in refuges must either: (1) decrease with increasing prey density, or (2) increase with both increasing predator density and increasing predation pressure. We also examine the effect of the cost of refuge use in decreased prey feeding or reproductive rates. Finally, we review some relevant empirical data and present some new data of our own.},

abstract = {A recent model, designed with stream systems in mind, suggested that prey exchange (movement of prey among patches) tends to reduce predator impacts on prey density; that is, rapid prey im migration into a patch with predators can swamp local effects of predators on prey density. The previous model, however, included two assumptions that influence the model's qualitative predictions. First, it assumed that the system's focal patches are surrounded by an environment that has no predators and a constant prey density. More importantly, it assumed that prey do not alter their per capita emigration rates in response to the presence of predators. We extended the earlier model by relaxing these assumptions. Specifically, we: (1) addressed predator impacts in patches surrounded by background environments that do not have predators, (2) allowed the background environment to have a constant or decreasing prey density (i.e., we examined situations in which predators deplete prey), and (3) accounted for the fact that prey per capita emigration rates are often altered by the presence of predators.Our most interesting results concerned the profound effects of prey emigration behavior on the relationship between prey exchange and predator impact. If prey do not alter their emigration rates in response to predators, then, as predicted by the earlier model, high prey exchange should result in very low predator impact. If, however, prey disperse out of patches in response to the presence of predators (i.e., if prey per capita emigration rates are higher out of patches with predators than out of predator-free patches), then even very high prey exchange rates cannot swamp predator impact; instead, prey emigration adds to predator impact. Thus, depending on prey emigration behavior, increased overall prey exchange can either decrease or increase predator impact. Predators can also suppress prey emigration (e.g., if prey hide in refuges so effectively that they disperse at low rates from predator patches). In that case, high prey exchange rates tend to result in ''negative predator impacts'' (i.e., higher prey density in patches with predators).The details of the above relationships are influenced by whether or not the background environment has predators. If the background has predators, but predators do not deplete prey (e.g., if predation is offset by recruitment), then predator impact depends only on the ratio of per capita emigration rates out of predator and predator-free patches; that is, attack rates do not influence predator impact. In contrast, if predators can deplete prey, then attack rates influence predator impact. In that situation, if attack rates are high relative to prey emigration rates out of predator-free patches, then predator impact steadily increases over time.A literature review suggested that prey alterations in per capita emigration rates in response to the presence of predators can potentially explain some surprising natural phenomena, including the existence of ''negative predator impacts,'' and the apparent tendency for invertebrate predators (primarily, stoneflies) to have stronger impacts on prey than vertebrate predators (primarily, fish). Finally, we discussed possible adaptive links between prey escape success, refuge use, dispersal behavior, and predator impacts. This discussion raised a ''paradox of danger'': that due to their effects on prey exchange, more dangerous predators might often have unexpectedly weak effects on local prey density. In this context, we suggest a framework for studying relationships between prey behavior, prey exchange, and predator impacts.},

The birds of three island archipelagoes and one set of mainland quadrats display strongly nested patterns, exactly as do most systems studied in this way. Nestedness may be expressed by several statistics, which are likely to be highly correlated, and may be viewed from either the community-wide or individual species vantagepoint. The latter is more informative. Individual species' nestedness scores can be similar even though the ecological forces generating them differ greatly. Nestedness scores based on island or site area are not directly comparable to those based on species richness. It is neither intuitively apparent nor empirically demonstrated that extinction would produce characteristically different nestedness scores than would colonization. Nestedness statistics are closely related to incidence functions in the ecological literature and to SLOSS comparisons in the conservation literature. None of these statistics is likely to provide much insight into refuge design.},

abstract = {A controlled experiment performed on 8 small mangrove islands constituted an exact test of several biogeographic hypotheses which had rested largely on unsatisfying statis- tical treatments. The islands were censused for arboreal arthropods; each contained a different subset of a species pool of {\~{}}500. Sections of the islands were then removed and censuses retaken after a waiting period; this procedure was repeated on four islands a second time. The results were consistent with a model which posits the islands as originally in a state of dynamic equilibrium between immigration and extinction, then re-equilibrating quickly when forced into an oversaturated condition. It was specifically demonstrated that: (1) species number increases with island size alone, independent of habitat diversity; (2) the increase with area is faster on separate islands than on increasing subsections of one island; (3) the area effect and the underlying dynamic equilibrium are not due only to an increased sample of transients and vagrants on larger islands, though there are a number of species which are particularly prone to quick extinction and which contribute disproportionately to the observed high turn- over rates; and (4) predictions of the effects of decreased area on species composition can be stochastic at best, not deterministic. The equilibrium theory prediction of higher turnover rate on smaller islands could not be conclusively tested because of small sample size. Several species interactions suggested by the distributional data are so subtle that it is apparent that much more intensive work will be required to demonstrate even the existence of interactions, let alone whether they are important. It is clear that much of the dynamic equilibrium and its associated turnover in this system can be ascribed to individual species characteristics and the effects of a rigorous physical environment},

Increasing propagule size enhances establishment probability primarily by lessening effects of demographic stochasticity, whereas propagule number acts primarily by diminishing impacts of environmental stochasticity. A continuing rain of propagules, particularly from a variety of sources, may erase or vitiate the expected genetic bottleneck for invasions initiated by few individuals (as most are), thereby enhancing likelihood of survival. For a few species, recent molecular evidence suggests ongoing propagule pressure aids an invasion to spread by introducing genetic variation adaptive for new areas and habitats. This phenomenon may also explain some time lags between establishment of a non-native species and its spread to become an invasive pest.},

abstract = {We report here the first evidence of faunistic equilibrium obtained through controlled, replicated experiments, together with an analysis of the immigration and extinction processes of animal species based on direct observations. The colonization of six small mangrove islands in Florida Bay by terrestrial arthropods was monitored at frequent intervals for 1 year after removal of the original fauna by methyl bromide fumigation. Both the observed data and climatic considerations imply that seasonality had little effect upon the basic shape of the colonization curves of species present vs. time. By 250 days after defaunation, the faunas of all the islands except the most distant one (@'EI@') had regained species numbers and composition similar to those of untreated islands even though population densities were still abnormally low. Although early colonists included both weak and strong fliers, the former, particularly psocopterans, were usually the first to produce large populations. Among these same early invaders were the taxa displaying both the highest extinction rates and the greatest variability in species composition on the different islands. Ants, the ecological dominants of mangrove islands, were among the last to colonize, but they did so with highest degree of predictability. The colonization curves plus static observations on untreated islands indicate strongly that a dynamic equilibrium number of species exists for any island. We believe the curves are produced by colonization involving little if any interaction, then a gradual decline as interaction becomes important, and finally, a lasting dynamic equilibrium. Equations are given for the early immigration, extinction, and colonization curves. Dispersal to these islands is predominantly through aerial transport, both active and passive. Extinction of the earliest colonists is probably caused chiefly by such physical factors as drowning or lack of suitable breeding sites and less commonly by competition and predation. As population sizes increase it is expected that competition and predation will become more important. Observed turnover rates showed wide variance, with most values between 0.05 and 0.50 species/day. True turnover rates are probably much higher, with 0.67 species/day the extreme lower limit on any island. This very high value is at least roughly consistent with the turnover equation derived from the MacArthur-Wilson equilibrium model, which predicts turnover rates on the order of 0.1-1.0 species/day on the experimental islands.},

Once the impact on any one species in a guild is determined, the impact on every other species in the guild is known" (140, p. 187). The guild concept thus became inextricably linked with the idea of indicator species (94), except that indicators were transformed to "guild-indicators" (155) rather than indicators of entire communities. The assumed solid status of the guild concept in academic ecology justified the relatively easy but controversial management practice of using censuses of single species' populations as indicators of population trends of other species and of habitat quality. Severinghaus also suggested that one might predict the effect of an environmental action on a guild in one region from its effect on a similar guild in another region.},

To assess the functional dynamics of microbial communities, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics have been developed.

Bacterial protein production method was an order of magnitude more sensitive and yielded bacterial carbon production directly without the need to know the cell size of the part of the assemblage in growth state.},

abstract = {MANY species exhibit colour polymorphisms associated with alternative male reproductive strategies, including territorial males and 'sneaker males' that behave and look like females1–3. The prevalence of multiple morphs is a challenge to evolutionary theory because a single strategy should prevail unless morphs have exactly equal fitness4,5 or a fitness advantage when rare6,7. We report here the application of an evolutionary stable strategy model to a three-morph mating system in the side-blotched lizard. Using parameter estimates from field data, the model predicted oscillations in morph frequency, and the frequencies of the three male morphs were found to oscillate over a six-year period in the field. The fitnesses of each morph relative to other morphs were non-transitive in that each morph could invade another morph when rare, but was itself invadable by another morph when common. Concordance between frequency-dependent selection and the among-year changes in morph fitnesses suggest that male interactions drive a dynamic 'rock–paper–scissors' game7.},

abstract = {Extracellular enzymes are the proximate agents of organic matter decomposition and measures of these activities can be used as indicators of microbial nutrient demand. We conducted a global-scale meta-analysis of the seven-most widely measured soil enzyme activities, using data from 40 ecosystems. The activities of beta-1,4-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase and phosphatase g(-1) soil increased with organic matter concentration; leucine aminopeptidase, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities showed no relationship. All activities were significantly related to soil pH. Specific activities, i.e. activity g(-1) soil organic matter, also varied in relation to soil pH for all enzymes. Relationships with mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP) were generally weak. For hydrolases, ratios of specific C, N and P acquisition activities converged on 1 : 1 : 1 but across ecosystems, the ratio of C : P acquisition was inversely related to MAP and MAT while the ratio of C : N acquisition increased with MAP. Oxidative activities were more variable than hydrolytic activities and increased with soil pH. Our analyses indicate that the enzymatic potential for hydrolyzing the labile components of soil organic matter is tied to substrate availability, soil pH and the stoichiometry of microbial nutrient demand. The enzymatic potential for oxidizing the recalcitrant fractions of soil organic material, which is a proximate control on soil organic matter accumulation, is most strongly related to soil pH. These trends provide insight into the biogeochemical processes that create global patterns in ecological stoichiometry and organic matter storage.},

abstract = {The degradation of detrital organic matter and assimilation of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) by heterotrophic microbial communities is mediated by enzymes released into the environment (ecoenzymes). For the attached microbial communities of soils and freshwater sediments, the activities of $\beta$-glucosidase, $\beta$-N-acetylglucosaminidase, leucine aminopeptidase, and phosphatase show consistent stoichiometric patterns. To determine whether similar constraints apply to planktonic communities, we assembled data from nine studies that include measurements of these enzyme activities along with microbial productivity. By normalizing enzyme activity to productivity, we directly compared the ecoenzymatic stoichiometry of aquatic biofilm and bacterioplankton communities. The relationships between $\beta$-glucosidase and $\alpha$-glucosidase and $\beta$-glucosidase and $\beta$-N-acetylglucosaminidase were statistically indistinguishable for the two community types, while the relationships between $\beta$-glucosidase and phosphatase and $\beta$-glucosidase and leucine aminopeptidase significantly differed. For $\beta$-glucosidase vs. phosphatase, the differences in slope (biofilm 0.65, plankton 1.05) corresponded with differences in the mean elemental C:P ratio of microbial biomass (60 and 106, respectively). For $\beta$-glucosidase vs. leucine aminopeptidase, differences in slope (0.80 and 1.02) did not correspond to differences in the mean elemental C:N of biomass (8.6 and 6.6). $\beta$-N-Acetylglucosaminidase activity in biofilms was significantly greater than that of plankton, suggesting that aminosaccharides were a relatively more important N source for biofilms, perhaps because fungi are more abundant. The slopes of $\beta$-glucosidase vs. ($\beta$-N-acetylglucosaminidase + leucine aminopeptidase) regressions (biofilm 1.07, plankton 0.94) corresponded more closely to the estimated difference in mean biomass C:N. Despite major differences in physical structure and trophic organization, biofilm and plankton communities have similar ecoenzymatic stoichiometry in relation to productivity and biomass composition. These relationships can be integrated into the stoichiometric and metabolic theories of ecology and used to analyze community metabolism in relation to resource constraints.},

abstract = {Macroecological patterns are found in animals and plants, but also in micro-organisms. Macroecological and biogeographic distribution patterns in marine Archaea, however, have not been studied yet. Ammonia-oxidizing Archaea (AOA) show a bipolar distri- bution (i.e. similar communities in the northernmost and the southernmost locations, separated by distinct communities in the tropical and gyral regions) throughout the Atlantic, detectable from epipelagic to upper bathypelagic layers ({\textless}2000 m depth). This tentatively suggests an influence of the epipelagic conditions of organic matter produc- tion on bathypelagic AOA communities. The AOA communities below 2000 m depth showed a less pronounced biogeographic distribution pattern than the upper 2000 m water column. Overall, AOA in the surface and deep Atlantic waters exhibit distance– decay relationships and follow the Rapoport rule in a similar way as bacterial commu- nities and macroorganisms. This indicates a major role of environmental conditions in shaping the community composition and assembly (species sorting) and no, or only weak limits for dispersal in the oceanic thaumarchaeal communities. However, there is indication of a different strength of these relationships between AOA and Bacteria, linked to the intrinsic differences between these two domains.},

abstract = {Ecologists have long investigated why communities are composed of a few common species and many rare species. Most studies relate rarity to either niche differentiation among species or spatial processes. There is a parallel between these processes and the processes proposed to explain the structure of metacommunities. Based on a metacommunity perspective and on data on stream macroinvertebrates from different regions of Brazil, we answer two questions. 1) Are sets of common and rare species affected by similar niche and spatial processes? 2) How does the community composition of common and of rare species differ? The main hypothesis we test is that common species are mainly affected by environmental factors, whereas rare species are mostly influenced by dispersal limitation. We used variation partitioning to determine the proportion of variation explained by the environment and space in common and rare species matrices. Contrary to our expectations, evidence supported the idea that both common and rare species are affected mainly by environmental factors, even after controlling for the differing information content between common and rare species matrices. Moreover, the abundance of some common species is also a good predictor of variation in rare species matrices. Niche differences are unlikely to be the sole cause of patterns of rarity in these metacommunities. We suggest that sets of common and rare species react to similar major environmental gradients and that rare species also respond to processes that operate at a more fine-grained spatial scale, particularly biotic interactions. We extend the view that species sorting is the dominant process structuring metacommunities and argue that future studies focusing on rarity would benefit from a metacommunity perspective},

abstract = {Ecosystems across the biosphere are subject to rapid changes in elemental balance and climatic regimes. A major force structuring ecological responses to these perturbations lies in the stoichiometric flexibility of systems - the ability to adjust their elemental balance whilst maintaining function. The potential for stoichiometric flexibility underscores the utility of the application of a framework highlighting the constraints and consequences of elemental mass balance and energy cycling in biological systems to address global change phenomena. Improvement in the modeling of ecological responses to disturbance requires the consideration of the stoichiometric flexibility of systems within and across relevant scales. Although a multitude of global change studies over various spatial and temporal scales exist, the explicit consideration of the role played by stoichiometric flexibility in linking micro-scale to macro-scale biogeochemical processes in terrestrial ecosystems remains relatively unexplored. Focusing on terrestrial systems under change, we discuss the mechanisms by which stoichiometric flexibility might be expressed and connected from organisms to ecosystems. We suggest that the transition from the expression of stoichiometric flexibility within individuals to the community and ecosystem scales is a key mechanism regulating the extent to which environmental perturbation may alter ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling dynamics.},

For the numerical solution of certain cases an iterative process is described and a short table of a new function is given. The equilibrium states of the various analytical models are considered in relation to the size of the habitat, and questions of stability are investigated. A mode of population growth resulting from the random scattering of the reproductive units in a population discrete in time, is deduced and used as a basis for study on interspecific competition.

The results are that in some cases it is possible for one species to exclude another species from a geographic region, but there is no possibility of a @'priority effect@' where the first species in the region can always exclude the other. Thus the equilibrium level of each species is determined by the parameters of the system and not by the initial conditions. Also, it is possible for two similar species to coexist in a region. A predator can increase the extinction rate of each species and, in some cases, permit coexistence where it would otherwise not be possible.

abstract = {We investigated bacterial responses to variations in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient availability by a comparative analysis of bacterial metabolism in lakes ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic. Bacterial growth, respiration, and growth efficiency were quantified in lake water dilution cultures performed in 20 lakes located in eastern Quebec, Canada, which varied with respect to both DOC and nutrient concentrations. Intrinsic growth rates of the bacteria ranged from 0.1 to 1.4 d21, bacterial cell-specific respiration rates ranged from 0.4 to 7.2 fg C cell21 h21, and growth efficiencies ranged from 6.7{\%} to 51.6{\%}. These variations were unrelated to bulk DOC concentrations. Instead, growth rate and efficiency were positively related to total phosphorus concentrations. Specific respiration rate, on the other hand, decreased with increasing phosphorus concentrations, and the magnitude of respiration, on a per-cell basis, strongly influenced observed growth efficiencies. In a series of substrate enrichment experiments, additions of glucose alone failed to stimulate a response in growth rate, mean cell biovolume, or the potential biomass yield in dilution cultures, but all responded positively to phosphorus additions. Our results show that bacterial metabolism and the fate of DOC input to lake microbial communities are strongly dependent on phosphorus availability, rather than total carbon availability. Extreme oligotrophy appears to place high respiratory demands on the bacterioplankton, resulting in very low bacterial growth efficiencies and consequently greater DOC flow to CO2 than to biomass available for transfer to higher trophic levels.},

Here we present a simple method by which the number of adaptive substitutions can be estimated and apply it to data from Drosophila simulans and D. yakuba.

Our analyses of data from 142 different natural ponds, lakes, and oceans and 239 experimental ecosystems reveal a strong species-area relationship with an exponent that is invariant across ecosystems that span {\textgreater}15 orders of magnitude in spatial extent. A striking result is that the species-area relationship derived from small-scale experimental studies correctly scales up to natural aquatic ecosystems. These results significantly broaden our knowledge of the effects of island size on biodiversity and also confirm the relevance of experimentally derived data to the analysis and understanding of larger-scale ecological patterns. In addition, they confirm that patterns in microbial diversity are strongly consistent with those that have been repeatedly reported in the literature for macroorganisms.},

abstract = {Much of the work on species coexistence has focused on the presence or absence of single mechanisms. Most theoretical frameworks, however, do not allow one to measure the strength of coexistence mechanisms, and so it has been difficult to determine the relative importance of each mechanism when multiple mechanisms are present. We present a model inspired by the California red scale system, in which two parasitoids coexist on a single, tree-dwelling host-scale insect. Previous work suggests that coexistence may be promoted both by intraguild predation (IGP) and by differing preferences for hosts on stems versus hosts on leaves (habitat preference). By applying an analytic framework that quantifies the strengths of spatial coexistence mechanisms, we are able to measure the individual contributions of IGP, habitat preference, and their interaction to maintaining coexistence. We find that habitat preference is much more effective at promoting coexistence in this model than in IGP. Furthermore, the effects of habitat preference and IGP are not independent. When the two parasitoids prefer different habitats, the coexistence-promoting effects of habitat preference are strengthened by IGP if IGP gives a moderate advantage to the inferior competitor. If IGP either confers an excessive advantage or favors the superior competitor, it can diminish the coexistence region.},

abstract = {Spatial coexistence depends on a variety of biological and physical processes, and the relative scales of these processes may promote or suppress coexistence. We model plant competition in a spatially varying environment to show how shifting scales of dispersal, competition, and environmental heterogeneity affect coexistence. Spatial coexistence mechanisms are partitioned into three types: the storage effect, nonlinear competitive variance, and growth-density covariance. We first describe how the strength of each of these mechanisms depends on covariances between population densities and between population densities and the environment, and we then explain how changes in the scales of dispersal, competition, and environmental heterogeneity should affect these covariances. Our quantitative approach allows us to show how changes in the scales of biological and physical processes can shift the relative importance of different classes of spatial coexistence mechanisms and gives us a more complete understanding of how environmental heterogeneity can enable coexistence. For example, we show how environmental heterogeneity can promote coexistence even when competing species have identical responses to the environment.},

I present an approximate calculation for the long-run growth rate of a species in the presence of spatially and temporally correlated environmental variation. I then perform a factorial numerical experiment, varying the mean seed dispersal distances, competition radii, and overwinter seed survival probabilities for two competing species for an array of variational regimes, noting the effects on their long-run growth rates. I find, first, that purely spatial variation has a greater capacity for influence than variation with a temporal component. Second, spatiotemporal variation can promote coexistence as strongly as purely temporal variation or more so, given the right species traits. Third, if the environmental variation has a spatial component, traits which enable species to become spatially segregated promote coexistence most strongly. That is, it is the possibility of spatial segregation which gives spatial variation its large potential to promote coexistence.},

abstract = {Both theoretical and empirical work have shown that the temporal storage effect can promote coexistence. However, the storage effect depends on temporally fluctuating demographic rates, such as interannually variable germination rates. Because variable demographic rates often reduce fitness, we asked how a storage effect might evolve. Using a model of competing annual plants, we find that variable germination (and hence a storage effect) can evolve only if germination is positively correlated with high-fecundity years (predictive germination) or if one species has limited ability to evolve. Outside of these conditions, the storage effect is evolutionarily unstable: if two species were thrown together with traits that would permit a storage effect, they would coevolve constant germination rates and the storage effect would vanish. Our results suggest that for the temporal storage effect to be widespread, either germination must commonly be positively correlated with later growth or fecundity or community assembly must reflect biogeographic processes more than they do coevolution.},

Using the lottery model as an example, we find that local dispersal contributes to coexistence by enhancing the effects of environmental variation on scales longer than typical dispersal distances, which can be characterized solely by the variance of the dispersal kernel.

Streamsin which exchange occurs between surface and subsurface (i.e. hyporheic) watersare thought to be conducive to nitrate removal via microbial assimilationand/ordenitrification. Hyporheic exchange was documented in the Neversink River inthesouthern Catskill Mountains, but dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate(NO3 −) losses along hyporheic flowpaths werenegligible. In this study, Neversink River water was amended with natural,bioavailable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) (leaf leachate) in a series ofexperimental mesocosms that simulated hyporheic flowpaths. DOC and N dynamicswere examined before and throughout a three week BDOC amendment. In addition,bacterial production, dissolved oxygen demand, denitrification, and sixextracellular enzyme activities were measured to arrive at a mechanisticunderstanding of potential DOC and NO3 − removalalong hyporheic flowpaths. There were marked declines in DOC and completeremoval of nitrate in the BDOC amended mesocosms. Independent approaches wereused to partition NO3 − loss into two fractions:denitrification and assimilation. Microbial assimilation appears to be thepredominant process explaining N loss. These results suggest that variabilityinBDOC may contribute to temporal differences in NO3 −export from streams in the Catskill Mountains.},

abstract = {In the recent past, availability of large data sets of species presences has increased by orders of magnitude. This, together with developments in geographical information systems and statistical methods, has enabled scientists to calculate, for thousands of species, the environmental conditions of their distributional areas. The profiles thus obtained are obviously related to niche concepts in the Grinnell tradition, and separated from those in Elton's tradition. I argue that it is useful to define Grinnellian and Eltonian niches on the basis of the types of variables used to calculate them, the natural spatial scale at which they can be measured, and the dispersal of the individuals over the environment. I use set theory notation and analogies derived from population ecology theory to obtain formal definitions of areas of distribution and several types of niches. This brings clarity to several practical and fundamental questions in macroecology and biogeography.},

Beta diversity—the turnover of community composition in space and time—has received particular attention. Here, I discuss recent findings in spatial and temporal turnover along abiotic and biotic gradients at two different extents. Turnover in space and time seem to exhibit similar scale dependency along latitudinal gradients; turnover is faster in the tropics at narrow study extents, but the pattern is reversed at broad extents as turnover accelerates nearer to the poles. Moreover, organisms at high trophic positions have higher turnover rates in space at broad study extents than do organisms at low trophic positions, but trophic position does not affect temporal turnover rates. Future studies that simultaneously examine variation in community composition in space, time, and along environmental gradients would shed more light on the mechanistic basis of community organization.},

abstract = {Macroecology examines the relationship between organisms and their environment at large spatial (and temporal) scales. Typically, macroecologists explain the large-scale patterns of abundance, distribution and diversity. Despite the difficulties in sampling and characterizing microbial diversity, macroecologists have recently also been interested in unicellular organisms. Here, I review the current advances made in microbial macroecology, as well as discuss related ecosystem functions. Overall, it seems that microorganisms suit surprisingly well to known species abundance distributions and show positive relationship between distribution and adundance. Microbial species-area and distance-decay relationships tend to be weaker than for macroorganisms, but nonetheless significant. Few findings on altitudinal gradients in unicellular taxa seem to differ greatly from corresponding findings for larger taxa, whereas latitudinal gradients among microorganisms have either been clearly evident or absent depending on the context. Literature also strongly emphasizes the role of spatial scale for the patterns of diversity and suggests that patterns are affected by species traits as well as ecosystem characteristics. Finally, I discuss the large role of local biotic and abiotic variables driving the community assembly in unicellular taxa and eventually dictating how multiple ecosystem processes are performed. Present review highlights the fact that most microorganisms may not differ fundamentally from larger taxa in their large-scale distribution patterns. Yet, review also shows that many aspects of microbial macroecology are still relatively poorly understood and specific patterns depend on focal taxa and ecosystem concerned.},

abstract = {The estimation of the relative roles of environment, space, and their interactions in structuring community composition is one of the central topics of community ecology. I conducted a quantitative review to determine if the degree of species sorting (SS) by the abiotic environment varied predictably between organism types and ecosystems. SS was quantified as the relative fraction of community variation that is explained by environmental variables. I integrated data from 326 variation partition analyses in a generalized linear model, and found that a mean of 26.1{\%} (minimum 0{\%}, maximum 88{\%}) of the variance in community composition was explained by environmental variables. I also found that organism body size and dispersal group were not related to the degree of SS. SS varied among trophic positions, being highest in autotrophs and omnivores and lowest in herbivores and decomposers. SS also varied among ecosystem types: it was lowest in lakes and highest in estuaries and marine environments. Studies using abundance data showed a higher degree of SS than studies based on presence–absence data. SS was lower when data sets were analyzed by spatial filters instead of by polynomials. These results suggest that although significant among-group differences emerged for trophic position and ecosystem type, variation in SS across body sizes or across different dispersal groups was relatively unpredictable. Nonetheless, these findings shed light on how the degree of SS varies across ecosystems or organism groups and may give important insights into the magnitude of environmental effects on biotic communities in a changing environment},

abstract = {The spatial structure of communities has recently gained much attention in ecology. Spatial structure comprises an important element in communities, but the literature lacks a thorough investigation about possible among-organism or among-ecosystem differences in the degree of spatial structure. Here, I conducted a quantitative review to determine if the degree of spatial structure varied predictably between the major organism types and ecosystems. Spatial structure was quantified as the relative fraction of community variation explained purely by spatial variables (fraction S/E). I integrated data from 322 variation partition analyses both in a generalized linear model (GLM) and using a boosted regression tree method, and showed that a mean of 11.0{\%} of the variation in community composition was explained purely by spatial variables. Across all taxa, a body size–S/E relationship was positive. In GLM, fraction S/E increased highly significantly with study extent, it was highest among terrestrial taxa and higher in ectotherms than in homoiotherms. Spatial structure was also higher in omnivores than in autotrophs. These results suggest that the degree of spatial structure is jointly driven by extrinsic factors such as study extent and ecosystem type, and intrinsic factors such as body size, thermoregulation and interactions between body size and dispersal mode. These results should be important not only for basic research, but also conservation and bioassessment programs would benefit from the information about the magnitude of spatial variation in nature.},

However, aquatic and terrestrial ecologists have mainly studied these ecosystems separately, a “splendid isolation” historically fostered by disciplinary boundaries between institutes and funding schemes. Here, we synthesize the progress made in joint aquatic and terrestrial research and suggest new approaches to meeting future research challenges in changing environments. Aquatic and terrestrial organisms use cross-system subsidies to a comparable extent and addressing reciprocal subsidies is therefore necessary in order to understand biodiversity and functioning of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We suggest that the metaecosystem framework could be expanded to explicitly consider cross-system fluxes of matter differing in magnitude and quality. We further advocate the inclusion of cross-system analyses at broader spatial extents, for which remote-sensing applications would be a useful tool in environmental research at the land–water interface. A cross-ecosystem approach would therefore be valuable for a more thorough understanding of ecosystem responses to various stressors in the face of rapid environmental change.},

We tested two main predictions: that the correlation between community similarity and geographical distance (spatial distance decay) is stronger at the across-drainage than at the within-drainage system scale, and that spatial distance decay is strongest for zooplankton and weakest for bacteria. We used a combination of direct ordination, multivariate statistical tests, and distance-based approaches to examine spatial patterns in our data. Our analyses confirmed both of our predictions. Spatial distance decay was scale-dependent{\&}semi; communities were overall weakly spatially structured within the drainage systems, yet distance decay was significant for all planktonic groups across drainage systems. Spatial distance decay was stronger for zooplankton, with higher slopes and shorter halving distances, than for phytoplankton and bacteria. These results provide evidence that distance decay of similarity is related to study scale, environment, and organism characteristics. Planktonic communities may be controlled by both dispersal-driven assembly and local ecological determinism, with the balance between these two forces depending on study scale.},

abstract = {The strengths of environmental drivers and biotic interactions are expected to show large variability across organism groups. We tested two ideas related to the degree of ecological determinism vs. stochasticity using a large data set comprising bacterio-, phyto-, and zooplankton. We expected that (1) there are predictable, size-driven differences in the degree to which planktonic taxa respond to different drivers such as water chemistry, biotic interactions, and climatic variables; and (2) species distribution models show lowest predictive performance for the smallest taxa due to the stochastic distributions of microbes. Generalized linear models (GLMs), generalized additive models (GAMs), and generalized boosted methods (GBMs) were constructed for 84 species to model their occurrence as a function of eight predictors. Predictive performance was measured as the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic plot and true skill statistic (TSS) using independent model evaluation data. We found that the model performances were typically remarkably low for all planktonic groups. The proportion of satisfactory models (AUC {\textgreater} 0.7) was lowest for bacteria (11.1{\%} of the models), followed by phyto- (24.2{\%}) and zooplankton (38.1{\%}). The occurrences of taxa within all planktonic groups were related to climatic variables to a certain degree, but bacteria showed the strongest associations with the climatic variables. Moreover, zooplankton occurrences were more related to biotic variables than the occurrences of smaller taxa, while phytoplankton occurrences were more related to water chemistry. We conclude that the occurrences of planktonic taxa are highly unpredictable and that stochasticity in occurrences is negatively related to the organism size perhaps due to efficient dispersal and fast population dynamics among the smallest taxa.},

abstract = {Biological similartiy typically decreases with geographical distance. Despite the recent attention to the distance decay relationship, there is no consensus on how the relationship varies across organism groups, geographic gradients and environments. We first conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of 401 distance decay relationships across a wide range of organisms, ecosystems and geographical gradients, and then united the effects of categorical and continuous variables on the rate of distance decay using a general linear model (GLM). As effect sizes we used the similarity at one km distance (initial similarity) and the distance that halves the similarity from its value at one km distance (halving distance). Both the initial similarity and halving distance were significantly affected by variables characterizing the spatial scale, organism properties, study region and ecosystem concerned. The patterns appear robust as the results of meta-analysis and GLM only differed in marginal details. According to GLM with Akaike's information criterion, the most parsimonious models explained 55.3 and 37.6{\%} of variance in initial similarity and halving distance, respectively. Across large scales, similarity was decreasing slightly faster at high latitudes than at low latitudes, while small-scale turnover was higher at low latitudes. We also found significant differences in initial similarity among the realms, with terrestrial systems showing higher small-scale beta diversity. The decrease in community similarity at large scales was higher among organisms that are actively mobile than among passively dispersed organisms. We conclude that regression of similarity against distance unites several ecological phenomena such as dispersal propensity and environmental structuring, and provides an effective approach for gauging the spatial turnover across sites. We also found that the patterns in beta-diversity are highly scale-dependent.},

abstract = {In urban and other built environments, management decisions serve as a prominent feedback between biodiversity patterns and human-controlled environmental variables. In this study, we used the metacommunity concept to assess the mechanisms that link zooplankton biodiversity to different management regimes in urban water bodies associated with the Baltimore Ecosystem Study Long-Term Ecological Research site (USA). In the summer of 2011, we sampled zooplankton in 21 ponds built for stormwater management. Ponds were classified as either unmanaged (n=9) or actively managed (n=12) for recreation and aesthetic value, where managed ponds received multiple chemical and algaecide applications to improve water clarity. We found managed ponds had higher local (alpha) diversity and lower spatial turnover in community composition (beta-diversity), and thus greater biotic homogenization than ponds that were unmanaged. We developed a lottery-based metacommunity simulation (MCSim) to assess how niche and dispersal dynamics could create the observed biodiversity patterns, and to assess whether biotic homogenization was related to management. A comparison of empirical and simulated diversity patterns suggests the zooplankton pond metacommunity was influenced by both dispersal and niche-based community assembly dynamics. Simulations showed that the observed biotic homogenization effect was expected based on the spatially aggregated distribution of managed ponds, but pond management was not likely exacerbating biotic homogenization in this system. Such insight is essential to understand how environmental management can affect biodiversity at local and regional scales.},

In particular, bacterial pathogens allow us to develop analytical methods to detect genetic adaptation using an evolutionary 'source-sink' model, with which the evolution of bacterial pathogens can be seen from the angle of continuous switching between permanent (source) and transient (sink) habitats.

abstract = {Dissolved Kjeldahl N and nitrate concentrations were monitored for 1 to 2 years before and for 3 years after clearcutting of a 10.2-ha, Douglas-fir dominated watershed in the Oregon Cascade Mountains. Dissolved organic C (DOC) and ammonium concentrations were monitored after cutting. We sampled throughfall, litter leachate, and soil solution (at four depths in and below the rooting zone) at four locations along a transect up and down the slope. We also sampled precipitation, streamwater, and seepage water. A site just off of the watershed served as the control for all positions in the water profile except for streamwater, for which a similar, nearby watershed was the control. Objectives were (1) to document effects of clearcutting on solution chemistry and (2) to provide data from which to calculate ecosystem nutrient cycling budgets before and after cutting. Beginning 7–18 months after clearcutting, nitrate concentrations increased 3–100 times on the cut watershed but remained nearly unchanged on an adjacent, uncut, control area. Increases were greater at 2.0-m depth than at other positions along the water profile and least in seepage and streamwater. Greatest nitrate levels were detected near the bottom of the slope. At the uppermost site, about 50 m below the ridgetop, nitrate values remained the same as at the control site. Concentrations of Kjeldahl N (organic N plus ammonium) increased much less than those of nitrate (only 50–100{\%} over precut levels) but were greater than nitrate concentrations at most profile positions both before and after cutting. Even after cutting, nitrate dominated only at 2.0-m depth and in seepage water. DOC concentrations were slightly greater on the cutover area than on the control. However, they increased as much as 3 times from year 2 to year 3 after cutting at both treated and control sites, whereas nitrate decreased from year 2 to 3, and Kjeldahl N increased little or remained the same. DOC concentrations decreased consistently with depth in the soil profile. The study showed (1) that dissolved organic N must be measured if total N transfers are to be calculated at most sites, (2) that patterns of nitrate appearance can be explained in part on the basis of decreased availability of oxidizable C, (3) that patterns of nitrate appearance after devegetation vary greatly with depth in the soil and with slope position, and (4) that loss of dissolved N after cutting was small ({\textless}2.0 kg ha−1 yr−1) compared with nearly 400 kg N ha−1 removed in tree boles.},

abstract = {For ecological and environmental data, prior inquiries into spatial sampling designs have considered two-dimensional domains and have shown that design optimality depends on the characteristics of the target spatial domain and intended inference. The structure and water-driven continuity of streams prompted the development of spatial autocovariance models for stream networks. The unique properties of stream networks, and their spatial processes, warrant evaluation of sampling design characteristics in comparison with their two-dimensional counterparts. Common inference scenarios in stream networks include spatial prediction, estimation of fixed effects parameters, and estimation of autocovariance parameters, with prediction and fixed effects estimation most commonly coupled with autocovariance parameter estima- tion.We consider these inference scenarios under a suite of network characteristics and stream-network spatial processes. Our results demonstrate, for parameter estimation and prediction, the importance of collecting samples from specific net- work locations. Additionally, our resultsmirror aspects from the prior two-dimensional sampling design inquiries, namely, the importance of collecting some samples within clusters when autocovariance parameter estimation is required. These results can be applied to help refine sample site selection for future studies and further showcase that understanding the characteristics of the targeted spatial domain is essential for sampling design planning.},

abstract = {Lotic ecosystems are substantially different than most other ecosystems because the continuous unidirectional flow through tl,e system tends to transport matter to downstream reaches. This gives rise to the common erroneous view of streams as conduits or pipes. The process of retention re{\textperiodcentered} moves matter from transport and makes it available for utilization by stream biota, thus providing a critical link between input and storage. The retentive properties of a stream arc functions of both hydrologic and substr{\~{}}te-rclated fea- tures. Heterogeneity of channel structure and current velocity creates obstructions and slack water areas that enhance retention efficiencies of streams. The retention of a particle in transport is a func{\textperiodcentered} . tion of the probability of entrainment of the particle on an obstacle and the frequency of obstacles in the channel (YouNG et al. 1978). A particle also will be retained in areas where the current veloc{\textperiodcentered} ity is less than the velocity required to keep the panicle in suspension . When one of these condi- tions is met, the particle will be retained until flow conditions change and it is transported down- stream. The influence of riparian vegetation on biological processes in streams extends beyond food re{\textperiodcentered} sources and habitat. The effects of riparian vegetation on channel structure and organic inputs in streams determine the efficiency with which matter is retained. In this paper, we describe a method for the quantitative assessment of retention of particulate oq:;anic matter in streams and identify several major stream retention features that can be influenced by the structure and composition of riparian zones.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effect of coarse woody debris (CWD) on mineral soils at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the central Cascade Range of Oregon, U.S.A. Nutrients in CWD leachates were compared with (i) forest floor (control) leachates, (ii) over a decay chronosequence, and (iii) among CWD of four species. There were few differences among CWD leachates and forest floor leachates. Soils under CWD were warmer but not wetter than control soils. Water-soluble organic carbon was higher in soils under CWD than in controls at 5-15 cm depth (p{\textless}0.02), but soil C concentrations did not differ. Gross N mineralization was faster in control soils. We found no differences in N, P, microbial biomass, Biolog plate assays, or enzyme activity in soils. Nutrient leachate differences among CWD species were small. Differences in solutions and in soils among CWD and controls were largest during the middle decay classes. This study suggests that either (i) CWD has no long-term effect and does not contribute large amounts of organic matter to the soil profile or (ii) the effect of CWD is so prolonged that no spatial affect is noticeable because all soils have been affected by CWD at some time.},

abstract = {Understanding the factors that determine the continued survival of small populations is a central problem in conservation biology. The Acorn Woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus) naturally occurs in small, isolated populations throughout much of the American Southwest. In spite of this distributional pattern, the species is neither rare nor endangered. Thus it appears to have successfully @'solved@' the problems to the problems of habitat fragmentation. We used data from a 10-yr field study and simulation models to examine the effects of environmental stochasticity on population survival times. All simulated woodpecker populations went extinct within 49 yr, and the median survival time was only 16 yr. However, when immigration was allowed, persistence times greatly increased; with an immigrant rate of only five individuals per year, most populations lasted {\textgreater}1000 yr. The results of this and other analyses suggest that this population persists only because it is part of a larger @'metapopulation,@' and because it is regularly rescued from extinction by immigration from other, independently varying, populations. This finding has important implications for the development of management strategies designed to preserve small populations that are faced with fragmented distributional patterns and high levels of environmental variation.},

abstract = {Floodplains of large alluvial rivers are often expansive and characterized by high volume hyporheic flow through lattice-like substrata, probably formed by glacial outwash or lateral migration of the river channel over long time periods. River water downwells into the floodplain at the upstream end; and, depending on bedrock geomorphology and other factors, groundwater from the unconfined aquifer upwells directly into the channel or into floodplain springbrooks at rates determined by head pressure of the water mass moving through the floodplain hydrologic system. These large scale (km3) hyporheic zones contain speciose food webs, including specialized insects with hypogean and epigean life history stages (amphibionts) and obligate groundwater species (stygobionts). Biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone may naturally load groundwaters with bioavailable solutes that appear to exert proximal controls on production and biodiversity of surface benthos and riparian vegetation. The effect is especially evident in floodplain springbrooks. Dynamic convergence of aquifer-riverine components adds physical heterogeneity and functional complexity to floodplain landscapes. Because reaches of aggraded alluvium and attendant ecotonal processes occur serially, like beads on a string, along the river continuum, we propose the concept of a hyporheic corridor in alluvial rivers. We expect predictable zonation of groundwater communities and other aquifer-riverine convergence properties within the corridor from headwaters to river mouth. The landscape-level significance and connectivity of processes along the hyporheic corridor must be better understood if river ecosystems, especially those involving large floodplain components, are to be protected and/or rehabilitated.},

abstract = {Our understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics of the distribution of the hyporheos can be considerably enhanced by an appreciation of surface-hyporheic hydrologic exchange. We illustrate this relationship using two case studies from very different lotic ecosystems: a large mesic river in France and an intermittent desert stream in Arizona. In both cases, there are strong correlations between direction and magnitude of hydrologic fluxes and the composition of hyporheic invertebrate assemblages. Hydrologists are likely to find that the distribution and abundance of hyporheos will provide useful corroborative data in studies of hyporheic flow dynamics, while ecologists should recognize the effects of hydrologic exchange between the surface stream and the hyporheic zone at a variety of scales. Thus hydrologic measurements of surface water and ground-water exchange should be included routinely in future studies of hyporheic invertebrate ecology. Such exchange controls the availability of nutrients, food, and dissolved gases to the hyporheos and indicates a mechanism whereby the subsurface component influences processes occurring in the rest of the lotic ecosystem.},

abstract = {Water loss from stream ecosystems has profound effects on primary producers. The small body of literature on algal responses to desiccation has emphasized mechanisms of resistance to desiccation, recovery of metabolic activity upon rewetting, and small spatial scales. Unfortunately, small-scale patterns are difficult to interpret because of the high degree of variability in both hydrologic patterns of drying and ecological processes within individual drainage basins. Consequently, effects of drying are best examined at larger spatial scales because variation that appears random at smaller scales become incorporated into larger, more predictable patterns across an entire catchment. We present a conceptual model of the effects of water loss on primary producers applicable to the scale of the entire catchment. This perspective describes differences in susceptibility to water loss, and differential rates of decline and recovery in primary production as a function of location within the catchment. Future considerations of drying on ecosystem attributes such as primary production will be facilitated by treating streams as patchy, interconnected landscapes in space and time and recognizing spatially explicit effects of disturbance. It is likely that streams of different regions vary widely in terms of the occurrence of drought, the geophysical template, and response variables (types of organisms present and their collective metabolism). The challenge in drought research today is to determine what phenomena are general and of widespread application and which are peculiar to given regions.},

abstract = {Stable isotope analysis is a powerful tool for unravelling the complex structure of food webs1±3. This technique is particularly well suited for studies at ecosystem boundaries, where physical processes and mobile consumers link the dynamics of seemingly disparate systems4±6. In coastal and insular environments, seabirds play a crucial role in transporting marine-based energy and nutrients to islands7±9. Here we show using stable isotopes that nutrients from the ocean drive the dynamics of terrestrial food webs on small islands. The indirect effects of seabird-derived nutrients on plant productivity are particularly prominent during wet El Nin{\"{A}}o Southern Oscillation years on our Gulf of California study sites. During dry years that characterize the region, many terrestrial consumers are subsidized by carrion and prey from the ocean. Shifts in trophic structure related to El Nin{\"{A}}o Southern Oscillation could only be elucidated because of the distinct nitrogen isotope ratios associated with seabird islands. The contributions of seabirds and other marine sources are re¯ected in the isotope signatures of terrestrial consumers in ways that challenge conventional interpretations of stable isotope results in studies of food webs.},

abstract = {Life history theory tries to explain how evolution designs organisms to achieve reproductive success. The design is a solution to an ecological problem posed by the environment and subject to constraints intrinsic to the organism. Work on life histories has expanded the role of phenotypes in evolutionary theory, extending the range of predictions from genetic patterns to whole-organism traits directly connected to fitness. Among the questions answered are the following: Why are organisms small or large? Why do they mature early or late? Why do they have few or many offspring? Why do they have a short or a long life? Why must they grow old and die? The classical approach to life histories was optimization; it has had some convincing empirical success. Recently non-equilibrium approaches involving frequency-dependence, density-dependence, evolutionary game theory, adaptive dynamics, and explicit population dynamics have supplanted optimization as the preferred approach. They have not yet had as much empirical success, but there are logical reasons to prefer them, and they may soon extend the impact of life history theory into population dynamics and interspecific interactions in coevolving communities.},

abstract = {Microbes have central roles in ocean food webs and global biogeochemical processes, yet specific ecological relationships among these taxa are largely unknown. This is in part due to the dilute, microscopic nature of the planktonic microbial community, which prevents direct observation of their interactions. Here, we use a holistic (that is, microbial system-wide) approach to investigate time-dependent variations among taxa from all three domains of life in a marine microbial community. We investigated the community composition of bacteria, archaea and protists through cultivation-independent methods, along with total bacterial and viral abundance, and physico-chemical observations. Samples and observations were collected monthly over 3 years at a well-described ocean time-series site of southern California. To find associations among these organisms, we calculated time-dependent rank correlations (that is, local similarity correlations) among relative abundances of bacteria, archaea, protists, total abundance of bacteria and viruses and physico-chemical parameters. We used a network generated from these statistical correlations to visualize and identify time-dependent associations among ecologically important taxa, for example, the SAR11 cluster, stramenopiles, alveolates, cyanobacteria and ammonia-oxidizing archaea. Negative correlations, perhaps suggesting competition or predation, were also common. The analysis revealed a progression of microbial communities through time, and also a group of unknown eukaryotes that were highly correlated with dinoflagellates, indicating possible symbioses or parasitism. Possible 'keystone' species were evident. The network has statistical features similar to previously described ecological networks, and in network parlance has non-random, small world properties (that is, highly interconnected nodes). This approach provides new insights into the natural history of microbes.},

Riverine systems, where groundwater mixes with surface water (the hyporheic zone), are spatially complex and temporally dynamic, making development of predictive models challenging. Spatial and temporal variations in hyporheic zone microbial communities are a key, but understudied, component of riverine biogeochemical function. Here, to investigate the coupling among groundwater–surface water mixing, microbial communities and biogeochemistry, we apply ecological theory, aqueous biogeochemistry, DNA sequencing and ultra-high-resolution organic carbon profiling to field samples collected across times and locations representing a broad range of mixing conditions. Our results indicate that groundwater–surface water mixing in the hyporheic zone stimulates heterotrophic respiration, alters organic carbon composition, causes ecological processes to shift from stochastic to deterministic and is associated with elevated abundances of microbial taxa that may degrade a broad suite of organic compounds.},

abstract = {Ecological community assembly is governed by a combination of (i) selection resulting from among-taxa differences in performance; (ii) dispersal resulting from organismal movement; and (iii) ecological drift resulting from stochastic changes in population sizes. The relative importance and nature of these processes can vary across environments. Selection can be homogeneous or variable, and while dispersal is a rate, we conceptualize extreme dispersal rates as two categories; dispersal limitation results from limited exchange of organisms among communities, and homogenizing dispersal results from high levels of organism exchange. To estimate the influence and spatial variation of each process we extend a recently developed statistical framework, use a simulation model to evaluate the accuracy of the extended framework, and use the framework to examine subsurface microbial communities over two geologic formations. For each subsurface community we estimate the degree to which it is influenced by homogeneous selection, variable selection, dispersal limitation, and homogenizing dispersal. Our analyses revealed that the relative influences of these ecological processes vary substantially across communities even within a geologic formation. We further identify environmental and spatial features associated with each ecological process, which allowed mapping of spatial variation in ecological-process- influences. The resulting maps provide a new lens through which ecological systems can be understood; in the subsurface system investigated here they revealed that the influence of variable selection was associated with the rate at which redox conditions change with subsurface depth.

abstract = {A major goal of microbial community ecology is to understand the forces that structure community composition. Deterministic selection by specific environmental factors is sometimes important, but in other cases stochastic or ecologically neutral processes dominate. Lacking is a unified conceptual framework aiming to understand why deterministic processes dominate in some contexts but not others. Here we work toward such a framework. By testing predictions derived from general ecological theory we aim to uncover factors that govern the relative influences of deterministic and stochastic processes. We couple spatiotemporal data on subsurface microbial communities and environmental parameters with metrics and null models of within and between community phylogenetic composition. Testing for phylogenetic signal in organismal niches showed that more closely related taxa have more similar habitat associations. Community phylogenetic analyses further showed that ecologically similar taxa coexist to a greater degree than expected by chance. Environmental filtering thus deterministically governs subsurface microbial community composition. More importantly, the influence of deterministic environmental filtering relative to stochastic factors was maximized at both ends of an environmental variation gradient. A stronger role of stochastic factors was, however, supported through analyses of phylogenetic temporal turnover. Although phylogenetic turnover was on average faster than expected, most pairwise comparisons were not themselves significantly non-random. The relative influence of deterministic environmental filtering over community dynamics was elevated, however, in the most temporally and spatially variable environments. Our results point to general rules governing the relative influences of stochastic and deterministic processes across micro- and macro-organisms.},

abstract = {The presence of prey heterogeneity and weakly interacting prey species is frequently viewed as a stabilizer of predator-prey dynamics, countering the destabilizing effects of enrichment and reducing the amplitude of population cycles. However, prior model explorations have largely focused on long-term, dynamic attractors rather than transient dynamics. Recent theoretical work shows that the presence of prey that are defended from predation can have strongly divergent effects on dynamics depending on time scale: prey heterogeneity can counteract the destabilizing effects of enrichment on predator-prey dynamics at long time scales but strongly destabilize systems during transient phases by creating long periods of low predator/prey abundance and increasing extinction probability (an effect that is amplified with increasing enrichment). We tested these general predictions using a planktonic system composed of a zooplankton predator and multiple algal prey. We first parameterized a model of our system to generate predictions and tested these experimentally. Our results qualitatively supported several model predictions. During transient phases, presence of defended algal prey increased predator extinctions at low and high enrichment levels compared to systems with only a single edible prey. This destabilizing effect was moderated at higher dilution rates, as predicted by our model. When examining dynamics beyond initial oscillations, presence of the defended prey increased predator-prey temporal variability at high nutrient enrichment but had no effect at low nutrient levels. Our results highlight the importance of considering transient dynamics when assessing the role of stabilizing factors on the dynamics of food webs.},

abstract = {The effects of prey heterogeneity and consumer identity on the strength of predator limitation of prey biomass were explored experimentally under controlled laboratory conditions. In this study, I utilized a model aquatic community composed of zooplankton as top predators, algae as prey, and nutrients as basal resources. To examine the effects of prey heterogeneity, I created a food chain initially composed of a single edible prey and a food web initially composed of a diverse assemblage of algae. These two prey treatments were then fully crossed with two predator treatments (a large-bodied zooplankter, Daphnia pulex, and a small-bodied species, Ceriodaphnia quadrangula), and two levels of productivity. Prey heterogeneity had clear effects on the ability of predators to limit overall prey biomass. In food chains, predators had strong negative effects on algae, and algal biomass exhibited a narrow response to enrichment. In contrast, predator limitation was weak in food webs with the consequence that predator and prey biomass both showed positive increases with productivity. The prey community in food webs also exhibited a striking increase in the relative abundance of large inedible algae with enrichment, in keeping with model predictions. These results indicate that prey heterogeneity can have substantial effects on predator-prey dynamics and trophic structure and can serve to shift systems from strong top-down control to ones in which prey are colimited by predators and resources. Comparisons between top predators showed that Daphnia, compared to Ceriodaphnia, more strongly limited the biomass of large algae in food webs at high productivity and total algal biomass in all nutrient-enriched treatments (both chains and webs). Thus, consumer identity and ecological context (productivity and heterogeneity of prey communities) may mediate the strength of zooplankton-algae interactions and the efficacy of trophic cascades.},

abstract = {A general prediction from simple metapopulation models is that spatially synchronized forcing can spatially synchronize population dynamics and destabilize metapopulations. In contrast, spatially asynchronous forcing is predicted to decrease population synchrony and promote temporal stability and population persistence, especially in the presence of dispersal. Only recently have studies begun to experimentally address these predictions. Moreover, few studies have experimentally examined how such processes operate in the context of competition communities. Stabilizing processes may continue to operate when placed within a metacommunity context with multiple competing consumers but only at low to intermediate levels of dispersal. High dispersal rates can reverse these predictions and lead to destabilization. We tested this under controlled conditions using an experimental aquatic system composed of three competing species of zooplankton. Metacommunities experienced different levels of dispersal and environmental forcing in the form of spatially synchronous or asynchronous pH perturbations. We found support that dispersal can have contrasting effects on population stability depending on the degree to which population dynamics were synchronized in space. Dispersal under synchronous forcing or no forcing had either neutral of positive effects on spatial population synchrony of all three zooplankton species. In these treatments, dispersal reduced population stability at the local and metapopulation levels for two of three species. In contrast, asynchronously varying environments reduced population synchrony relative to unforced systems, regardless of dispersal level. In these treatments, dispersal enhanced temporal stability and persistence of populations not by reducing population synchrony but by enhancing population minima and spatial averaging of abundances. High dispersal rates under asynchronous forcing reduced the abundance of one species, consistent with increasing regional competition and general metacommunity theory. However, no effects on its stability or persistence were observed. Our work highlights the context-dependent effects of dispersal on population dynamics in varying environments.},

abstract = {How numerous tree species can coexist in diverse forest communities is a key question in community ecology. Whereas neutral theory assumes that species are adapted to common field conditions and coexist by chance, niche theory predicts that species are functionally different and coexist because they are specialized for different niches. We integrated biophysical principles into a mathematical plant model to determine whether and how functional plant traits and trade-offs may cause functional divergence and niche separation of tree species. We used this model to compare the carbon budget of saplings across 13 co-occurring dry-forest tree species along gradients of light and water availability. We found that species ranged in strategy, from acquisitive species with high carbon budgets at highest resource levels to more conservative species with high tolerances for both shade and drought. The crown leaf area index and nitrogen mass per leaf area drove the functional divergence along the simulated light gradient, which was consistent with observed species distributions along light gradients in the forest. Stomatal coordination to avoid low water potentials or hydraulic failure caused functional divergence along the simulated water gradient, but was not correlated to observed species distributions along the water gradient in the forest. The trait-based biophysical model thus explains how functional traits cause functional divergence across species and whether such divergence contributes to niche separation along resource gradients.},

Instead, the cells became committed in turn to the following successive events connected with sporulation: formation of alkaline phosphatase, development of refractility, synthesis of dipicolinic acid and development of heat-resistance. 3. Each point of commitment was followed within about 30min. by a period in which the event concerned ceased to be inhibited by actinomycin D. 4. The implication of these results is that each point of commitment is probably due to the formation of a species of long-lived messenger RNA and that, in any case, sporulation is regulated at the level of both transcription and translation. 5. It is also shown that sporulation and growth are perhaps not mutually exclusive functions and that histidase, an enzyme typical of the vegetative state, can be induced in sporulating suspensions.},

@article{Stone1990,
abstract = {There has been an ongoing controversy over how to decide whether the distribution of species is “random” — i.e., whether it is not greatly different from what it would be if species did not interact. We recently showed (Roberts and Stone (1990)) that in the case of the Vanuatu (formerly New Hebrides) avifauna, the number of islands shared by species pairs was incompatible with a “random” null hypothesis. However, it was difficult to determine the causes or direction of the community's exceptionality. In this paper, the latter problem is examined further. We use Diamond's (1975) notion of checkerboard distributions (originally developed as an indicator of competition) and construct a C-score statistic which quantifies “checkerboardedness”. This statistic is based on the way two species might colonise a pair of islands; whenever each species colonises a different island this adds 1 to the C-score. Following Connor and Simberloff (1979) we generate a “control group” of random colonisation patterns (matrices), and use the C-score to determine their checkerboard characteristics. As an alternative mode of enquiry, we make slight alterations to the observed data, repeating this process many times so as to obtain another “control group”. In both cases, when we compare the observed data for the Vanuatu avifauna and the Antillean bat communities with that given by their respective “control group”, we find that these communities have significantly large checkerboard distributions, making implausible the hypothesis that their species distributions are a product of random colonisation.},

abstract = {There is a long-standing dispute over whether the analysis of species co-occurrence data, typically on islands in an archipelago, can disclose the forces at work in structuring a community. Here we present and utilise three "scores" S, C and T. S gives the mean number of islands shared by a species pair in the presence/ab- sence data under study. The scores C and T are based on the way that a pair of species occurs on a pair of islands. When each species occurs on a different island, this adds to the "checkerboard score" C; if they occupy the same island, this increases the "togetherness score" T. In judging whether observed values of S, C and T are compatible with a null hypothesis assuming no spe- cies interaction, we follow Connor and Simberloff (1979) in generating a "control group" of (constrained) simulat- ed incidence patterns. Presence/absence matrices can have paradoxical fea- tures, in combining a high mutual exclusion by species (checkerboardedness) with a degree of species aggrega- tion that is also high. We show that this is in fact inevita- ble - that, given the usual contraints, C and T can differ only by a constant. This means that extreme checker- boardedness can be produced by forces making for spe- cies aggregation, just as well as by those making for avoidance. If we restrict our attention to a subset of species, the constraints are less rigid and the S, C and T scores are somewhat freer to vary. We consider the confamilial sub- sets in the Vanuatu archipelago as likely candidates for revealing any competition forces at work. Calculating the actual S, C and T scores for these subsets, we com- pare them with the corresponding scores in a sample of simulated colonization patterns. The actual species-distributions differ significantly from what we would expect if the colonization choices of different species were uncorrelated (save for some bio- logical constraints). The confamilial species of the real world share more islands, and occur in a pattern less checkerboarded, and more aggregated, than their simu- lation counterparts. This suggests that competition pres- sures, if they exist, are overcome by countervailing fac- tors. The method used is applicable in other ways, and to a wider class of problems, in analysing the forces be- hind community structure.},

@article{Storey1999,
abstract = {1. Studies of hyporheic microbial ecology have suggested an important role for hyporheic microbial processes in stream ecosystem functioning. Using evidence from microbial communities in other aquatic habitats, some predictions are made concerning the diversity of microbial types and microbial processes likely to occur in the hyporheic zone, and the relative importance of these various types to the hyporheic ecosystem. 2. It is predicted that the biofilm growth form of interstitial micro-organisms will create a variety of microniches, allowing coexistence of a great diversity of microbial types, and promoting the activity of some otherwise poor competitors. It is further predicted that the confluence of reduced groundwaters and aerobic surface waters will favour chemolithotrophic processes in the hyporheic zone, but that these will contribute significantly to hyporheic production only if surface water is very low in dissolved organic carbon, or the groundwater is extremely reduced, such as by the influence of riparian wetlands. A variety of anaerobic respiratory pathways, such as nitrate, ferric ion, sulphate and even methanogenic respiration will be employed in the hyporheic zone, with biofilm dynamics permitting these to occur even in aerobic sediments. Anaerobic pathways may account for a significant proportion of total hyporheic organic matter mineralization. 3. The role of fungi in hyporheic dynamics is, as yet, almost completely unstudied. However, it is expected that they will be important in breaking down buried particulate organic matter (POM), which may account for a large proportion of total stream POM. 4. Physicochemical conditions in hyporheic sediments appear to be highly heterogeneous, and this heterogeneity may be very important in the cycling of certain nutrients, especially nitrogen, which involves a series of steps requiring different conditions. 5. Various new techniques are now available by which biofilm dynamics and in situ microbial processes may be measured. Studies are recommended of intact microbial communities both at the microscale of the biofilm and at the scale of the heterogeneities occurring in hyporheic sediments. Studies are needed that measure actual rates of microbial processes under in situ conditions.},

abstract = {Quantitative geomorphic methods developed within the past few years provide means of measuring size and form properties of drainage basins. Two general classes of descriptive numbers are (1) linear scale measurements, whereby geometrically analogous units of topography can be compared as to size, and (2) dimensionless numbers, usually angles or ratios of length measures whereby the shapes of analogous units can be compared irrespective of scale. Linear scale measurements include length of stream channels of given order, drainage density, constant of channel maintenance, basin perimeter, and relief. Surface and cross-sectional areas of basins are length products. If two drainage basins are geometrically similar, all corresponding length dimensions will be in a fixed ratio. Dimensionless properties include stream order numbers, stream length and bifurcation ratios, junction angles, maximum valley-side slopes, mean slopes of watershed surfaces, channel gradients, relief ratios, and hypsometric curve properties and integrals. If geometrical similarity exists in two drainage basins, all corresponding dimensionless numbers will be identical, even though a vast size difference may exist. Dimensionless properties can be correlated with hydrologic and sediment-yield data stated as mass or volume rates of flow per unit area, independent of total area of watershed.},

abstract = {It remains challenging to predict variation in the magnitude of disease outbreaks. The dilution effect seeks to explain this variation by linking multiple host species to disease transmission. It predicts that disease risk increases for a focal host when host species diversity declines. However, when an increase in species diversity does not reduce disease, we are often unable to diagnose why. Here, we increase mechanistic and predictive clarity of the dilution effect with a general trait-based model of disease transmission in multi-host communities. Then, we parameterise and empirically test our model with a multi-generational case study of planktonic disease. The model-experiment combination shows that hosts that vary in competitive ability (R*) and potential to spread disease (R0 ) can produce three qualitatively disparate outcomes of dilution on disease: the dilution effect can succeed, fail, or be ambiguous/irrelevant.},

abstract = {Aquatic macroinvertebrates inhabiting temporary rivers are typically described as having low resistance to riverbed drying. However, little research has examined the seedbank' within dry riverbed sediments, which comprises aquatic life stages that survive in dewatered sediments and from which active organisms may develop only after surface water returns. We synthesised published and unpublished data from studies that had experimentally rehydrated sediments collected from dry riverbeds, to establish the importance of the seedbank in promoting macroinvertebrate community resistance. Studies from across climate zones were included, to examine seedbank importance in relation to environmental harshness and, in particular, sediment moisture. We also assessed the importance of the seedbank relative to alternative habitats promoting persistence of the flowing river (FR) assemblage. We predicted that the proportion of the FR assemblage present in rehydrated sediments (RS) would decrease with environmental harshness, due to conditions within the sediments becoming less conducive to the survival of biota. A negative relationship between the proportion of FR taxa present in RS and harshness was observed, and this contributed to a reduction in the compositional similarity of FR and RS assemblages as harshness increased. Significant positive correlations were identified between sediment moisture content and macroinvertebrate community metrics (density and taxon richness) in some systems. Habitats external to the dry reach, which contribute to community resilience, were invariably inhabited by a greater number of FR taxa than rehydrated sediments. However, rehydrated sediments included several FR taxa that were not found in any other habitats during the dry phase, including families of Coleoptera and Diptera. Our results indicate the importance of the seedbank as a resistance mechanism for temporary river macroinvertebrates. With climate change scenarios predicting an increase in riverbed drying, maintaining habitats that facilitate the persistence of instream communities during dry phases is an increasing priority. We identified strong relationships between sediment moisture and taxon richness, and river management and rehabilitation activities should therefore aim to retain moisture in drying sediments, by manipulating parameters such as riparian shading.},

abstract = {A field study was conducted in the Lower East Fork of the Little Miami River, a regulated stream in Clermont county, Ohio, to determine how changes in streamflow, water temperature and photo-period affect sediment microbial community structure. Surface sediment cores were collected from sampling stations spanning 60 river kilometers three to four times per year between October 1996 and October 1999. During the final year of the field study, water temperature, water depth, conductivity, total suspended solids, dissolved organic carbon, instantaneous streamflow velocity, sediment grain size and sediment organic matter were determined. Total microbial biomass was measured using the phospholipid phosphate technique (PLP) and ranged between 2 and 134 nmol PLP . g(-1) dry weight sediment with a mean of 25 nmol PLP . g(-1) . Microbial community structure was determined using the phospholipid fatty acid analysis and indicated seasonal shifts in sedimentary microbial community composition. January to June sedimentary microbial biomass was predominately prokaryotic (60{\%} +/- 2), whereas microeukaryotes dominated samples collected during the late summer (55{\%} +/- 2.4) and fall (60{\%} +/- 2). These changes were correlated with stream discharge and water temperature. Microbial community structure varied spatially about a reservoir with prokaryotic biomass dominant at upstream stations and eukaryotic biomass dominant at downstream stations. These findings reveal that sedimentary microbial communities in streams are dynamic responding to the seasonal variation of environmental factors.},

abstract = {Dispersal of organisms connects physical localities, but the strength of connection varies widely. Variability in the infl uence of dispersal can be predictable in sharply defi ned networks like river systems because some sections of the network are more isolated, leading to diff erent balances of local (i.e. environmental fi ltering, species interactions) and regional (i.e. dispersal- driven) processes in structuring communities. We examined the infl uence of spatial isolation on the relative contributions of $\alpha$ - and $\beta$ -diversity to regional ( $\gamma$ ) diversity, and examined how that infl uence diff ered between common and rare species in stream macroinvertebrate communities. One explanation for rarity on a regional scale is that common species are habitat generalists while rare species are specialists. Th erefore, common species should be infl uenced more by dispersal-driven processes while rare species should be more infl uenced by local processes. We predicted that for rare taxa, $\beta$ -diversity should represent a higher fraction of $\gamma$ -diversity in isolated headwaters but that diff erences between rare and common taxa with regard to the contribution of $\beta$ -diversity to $\gamma$ -diversity should be less distinct in well-connected mainstem habitats. To test these predictions, we used macroinvertebrate communities from 634 sites across 22 watersheds. Regardless of rarity, $\beta$ - and $\gamma$ -diversity were higher in headwaters compared to mainstems. However, $\alpha$ -diversity was similar regardless of isolation for rare assemblages. But contrary to our predictions, common assemblages of predators and herbivores did exhibit diff erences in $\alpha$ -diversity between locations. Our predictions were strongly supported for two guilds of consumers, the detritivores and collectors, but less so for herbivores and predators. However, these results make sense considering diff erences in life histories between the groups. For detritivores and collectors, species turnover ( $\beta$ -diversity) was higher in isolated regions in river networks, and rarity exacerbated this eff ect, resulting in higher regional diversity of rare species, supporting the general},

abstract = {Based on a functional rather than vegetative or topographic definition, the riparian zone is the area of direct interaction between aquatic and terrestrial environments. Riparian zone vegetation in coniferous forests of the Pacific Northwest is typically composed of low strata of herbs and deciduous shrubs and small trees between a canopy of large conifers. The composition and structure of riparian plant communities are largely determined by light availability; substrate conditions such as wetness, frequency and intensity of scouring; and availability of sites for rooting. First- through third-order sites, larger streams have higher cover of shrub, and large shrub/small tree strata, apparently in response to greater light availability due to opening of the overstory. Vegetation along small and intermediate-sized streams (up to about fourth order) exercises important controls over physical conditions in the stream environment. Rooting by herbaceous and woody vegetation tends to stabilize streambanks, retard erosion, and determine bank morphology. Large pieces of woody debris in streams: (1) control routing of sediment and water through channel systems; (2) dissipate stream energy; (3) define habitat opportunities; and (4) serve as substrates for biological activity by microbial and invertebrate organisms.},

abstract = {Patterns of plant species richness and community composition were studied in diverse riparian zones. Eight rivers in south-western France, one river in north-western USA and four rivers in south-eastern Spain were compared. A brief review is presented of factors that have been singled out as controlling diversity along rivers. The proportions of plant group classified according to life-span, morphology, ruderality and location along the rivers were analysed. Both proportions of plant traits and total species richness differed considerably between rivers. Semi-arid rivers were more influenced by local patterns than the other rivers. The patterns exhibited by true riparian species and invading, essentially non-riparian species, showed the importance of the relationships between the river and its close surroundings. The mean proportion of ruderals remained roughly the same in all rivers, suggesting some regulatory mechanisms independent of the general environmental settings. The longitudinal patterns of species richness in riparian plant communities of the oceanic rivers could be related to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, whereas semi-arid rivers showed very irregular patterns of species richness along their courses, as a consequence of the irregular water availability. Exotic and ruderal species were more sensitive than other groups to the longitudinal zonation of the rivers and to environmental factors influenced by humans. Also, the permanency of superficial water appeared as a major factor in the control of riparian community structure in semi-arid regions.},

It is found that the correlation between these two estimates is large when the sample size is small, and decreases slowly as the sample size increases. Using the relationship obtained, a statistical method for testing the neutral mutation hypothesis is developed. This method needs only the data of DNA polymorphism, namely the genetic variation within population at the DNA level. A simple method of computer simulation, that was used in order to obtain the distribution of a new statistic developed, is also presented. Applying this statistical method to the five regions of DNA sequences in Drosophila melanogaster, it is found that large insertion/deletion (greater than 100 bp) is deleterious. It is suggested that the natural selection against large insertion/deletion is so weak that a large amount of variation is maintained in a population.},

abstract = {Intraguild predation is the simplest, ubiquitous form of trophic omnivory, known to greatly influence the structure and functioning of natural and managed food webs. Although alternative states are fundamental to intraguild predation dynamics, only necessary conditions for alternative states have been previously reported. Using simple models, we found complex but systematic patterns in which different alternative states occur along a productivity gradient, and clarified the sufficient conditions to separate these patterns. We found that two quantities known to control the necessary conditions also determine the sufficient conditions: (1) relative energy transfer efficiency through alternative trophic pathways to an intraguild predator, and (2) relative resource exploitation ability between intraguild prey and predator. These governing quantities suggest how body size and stoichiometric relations between intraguild prey and predators can influence the possibility of alternative states. Our results indicate that food webs involving intraguild predation have a high potential of complex alternative states, and their management can be highly precarious. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Litter decay rates often correlate with the initial ratios of lignin : nitrogen (N) or lignin : cellulose in litter. However, the chemical and microbial mechanisms that give rise to these patterns are still unclear. To identify these mechanisms, we studied the decomposition of a model plant system, Arabidopsis thaliana, in which plants were manipulated to have low levels of lignin, cellulose, or litter N. Nitrogen fertilizer often increases the loss of cellulose, but it suppresses the breakdown of lignin in plant litter. To understand the mechanisms driving these patterns, we decomposed plants in litterbags for one year in control and N-fertilized plots in an Alaskan boreal forest. We found that litter N had a positive effect on total mass loss because it increased the loss of lignin, N, and soluble C. Lignin had a negative effect on rates of total litter mass loss due to decreases in the loss of cellulose and hemicellulose. Cellulose had a positive effect on lignin loss, supporting the concept of a ‘‘priming effect'' for lignin breakdown. However, the low-cellulose plants also lost more of their original cellulose compared to the other plant types, indicating that decomposers mined the litter for cellulose despite the presence of lignin. Low-lignin litter had higher fungal biomass and N-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAG, a chitinase) activity, suggesting that lignin restricted fungal growth and may have influenced competitive interactions between decomposers. Nitrogen fertilization increased NAG activity in the early stages of decay. In the later stages, N fertilization led to increased cellulase activity on the litters and tended to reduce lignin losses. The transition over time from competition among decomposers to high cellulase activity and suppressed lignin loss under N fertilization suggests that, in N-limited systems, N fertilization may alter decomposer community structure by favoring a shift toward cellulose- and mineral-N users.},

abstract = {Non-native plant species richness may be either negatively or positively correlated with native species due to differences in resource availability, propagule pressure or the scale of vegetation sampling. We investigated the relationships between these factors and both native and non-native plant species at 12 mainland and island forested sites in southeastern Ontario, Canada. In general, the presence of non-native species was limited:$\backslash$20{\%} of all species at a site were non-native and non-native species cover was $\backslash$4{\%} m-2 at 11 of the 12 sites. Non-native species were always positively correlated with native species, regardless of spatial scale and whether islands were sampled. Additionally, islands had a greater abundance of non-native species. Nonnative species richness across mainland sites was significantly negatively correlated with mean shape index, a measure of the ratio of forest edge to area, and positively correlated with the mean distance to the nearest forest patch. Other factors associated with disturbance and propagule pressure in northeastern North America forests, including human land use, white-tailed deer populations, understorey light, and soil nitrogen, did not explain non-native richness nor cover better than the null models. Our results suggest that management strategies for controlling non-native plant invasions should aim to reduce the propagule pressure associated with human activities, and maximize the connectivity of forest habitats to benefit more poorly dispersed native species.},

abstract = {We added (NH4Cl)-N-15 over 6 weeks to Upper Ball Creek, a second-order deciduous forest stream in the Appalachian Mountains, to follow the uptake, spiraling, and fate of nitrogen in a stream food web during autumn. A priori predictions of N flow and retention were made using a simple food web mass balance model. Values of delta(15)N were determined for stream water ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen, and various compartments of the food web over time and distance and then compared to model predictions. Ammonium uptake lengths were shortest at the beginning of the tracer addition (28 m) and increased through time (day 20 = 82 m; day 41 = 94 m), and ammonium residence time in stream water ranged from 4 min on day 0 to 15 min on day 41. Whole-stream ammonium uptake rates, determined from the decline in (NH4)-N-15 in water over the stream reach, decreased from 191 mg N m(-2) d(-1) on day 0 to 83.2 mg N m(-2) d(-2) on day 41. Temporal trends in the NH4 mass transfer coefficient (v(f)) were similar to uptake rates; v(f) was highest on day 0 (7.4 x 10(-4) m s(-1)) and lower on days 20 and 41 (2.7 and 2.8 x 10(-4) m s(-1), respectively). Rates of nitrification were estimated to be very low throughout the tracer addition and accounted for {\textless}3{\%} of (NH)-N-15, uptake on day 0. It appears that most of the N in epilithon was actively cycling based on comparisons of N-15 in stream water and biomass at the end of the experiment. In contrast, for allochthonous organic matter, we found that microbial N-15 represented 69{\%} of the label in wood, 20{\%} in leaves, and 31{\%} in fine benthic organic matter (FBOM). Despite higher delta(15)N values in primary producers, (NH4)-N-15 uptake rates per unit stream bottom area were generally lower in epilithon compared to the detrital compartments, a result of the lower biomass of epilithon. Turnover times were similar for epilithon (47 d), leaves (38 d), and FBOM (53 d) based on the decline in N-15 tracer over the first 28 d after the addition stopped. Incorporation of N-15 varied among biomass compartments involved in ammonium uptake from water. Primary producers were more highly labeled than allochthonous organic matter. Epilithon delta(15)N values were higher than leaves or FBOM, appeared to reach isotopic equilibrium by day 42, and followed model-predicted trends. The grazing mayfly Stenonema was more highly labeled than the epilithon, which suggests selective feeding or assimilation of the more highly labeled algal-bacterial portion of the epilithon. Leaves had very low delta(15)N values, and delta(15)N values for the shredding stonefly Tallaperla were close to model predictions and followed labeling in leaves. Total retention of N-15 at the end of the experiment by the nine largest biomass compartments within the study reach accounted for only 12.3{\%} of added N-15(4) With leaves and FBOM representing the largest portions. Export of N-15 by suspended particulate and dissolved N accounted for an additional 11{\%} and 30{\%} of added N-15(4) respectively. Results from the N-15-tracer addition in Upper Ball Creek demonstrate the high ammonium demand associated with microbes colonizing leaf detritus and the resultant linkage to invertebrate shredders. In Upper Ball Creek in autumn, spiraling of NH4 is very tight, NH4 residence time in water is short, and uptake rates are very high. Analyses of N spiraling in unimpacted streams provide an ecological foundation for assessment of spiraling in high-N streams.},

Leaf litter was excluded from one headwater stream in August 1993 at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in the southern Appalachian Mountains. We compared microbial processes on wood in the litter-excluded stream to a reference stream using microbial respiration, fungal biomass, and extracellular enzyme activity. Exclusion of leaf litter enhanced microbial respiration and extracellular enzyme activity, and fungal biomass was seven times higher than in the reference stream. Nutrient-releasing substrates placed beneath wood veneers indicated colimitation by nitrogen and phosphorus on biofilms in the reference stream. Our conclusion is that, in the absence of nutrient immobilization by leaves, nutrients are more available for other heterotrophic processes. Nutrient limitation may have been responsible for low microbial respiration, fungal biomass, and extracellular enzyme activity on wood in the reference stream containing leaves. Our results suggest that competition for nutrients may regulate heterotrophic microbial processes in these streams.},

In spite of the advances made thus far, there are many unexplored ways of integrating the science and application of urban ecology. Although scientists assess and make predictions regarding the connections between environmental and socioeconomic processes, practitioners involved in real-world application deal with urban planning and with designing ecosystem services to improve living con- ditions for all urban inhabitants and to make cities more sustainable. Research in urban ecosystems can be developed from many different perspectives, and we suggest that each perspective has something to offer both society and the science of ecology. We present several research perspectives and describe how these can inte- grate conceptual and applied aspects to bridge the figurative gaps between trees, buildings, and people.},

Investigators have recently suggested that channel slopes are self-similar with magnitude or area as a scaling parameter. Our data indicates otherwise; in particular, the variance ofchannel slope is larger than that predicted by simple self-similarity. This suggests multiscaling. The scaling exponent for the standard deviation is approximately half the corresponding exponent in the relationship of the slope mean to magnitude or area. A model for channel slopes based on a point process of elevation drops along the channel is presented. The model reproduces observed multiscaling properties when the density of elevation increments is related to area (or magnitude) as A*exp(-9).},

abstract = {I tested the effects of pool size and spatial position (upstream or downstream) on fish assemblage attributes in isolated and-connected pools in an upland Oklahoma stream, United States. I hypothesized that there would be fundamental differences between assemblages in these two pool types due to the presence or absence of colonization opportunities. Analyses were carried out at three ecological scales. (1) the species richness of pool assemblages, (2) the species composition of pool assemblages, and (3) the responses of individual species. There were significant species-volume relationships for isolated and connected pools. However, the relationship was weaker and there were fewer species, on average, in isolated pools. For both pool types, species incidences were significantly nested such that species-poor pools tended to be subsets of species-rich pools, a common pattern that ultimately results from species-specific differences in colonization ability and/or extinction susceptibility. To examine the potential importance of these two processes in nestedness patterns in both pool types, I made the following two assumptions: (I) probability of extinction should decline with increasing pool size, and (2) probability of immigration should decline in an upstream direction (increasing isolation). When ordered by pool volume, only isolated pools were significantly nested suggesting that these assemblages were extinction-driven. When ordered by spatial position, only connected pools were significantly nested (more species downstream) suggesting that differences in species-specific dispersal abilities were important in structuring these assemblages. At the individual-species level, volume was a significant predictor of occurrence for three species in isolated pools. In connected pools, two species showed significant position effects, one species showed a pool volume effect, and one species showed pool volume and position effects. These results demonstrate that pool size and position within a watershed are important determinants of fish species assemblage structure, but their importance varies with the colonization potential of the pools. Isolated pool assemblages are similar to the presumed relaxed faunas of montane forest fragments and land bridge islands, but at much smaller space rind time scales.},

abstract = {Hamilton (1967) pointed out that Fisher's (1930) argument predicting an equality of the sex ratio may break down when there is local competition for mates. He considered in particular a model in which the environment consists of a number of isolated patches, each of which is colonized by a number of inseminated females; the offspring breed within the patch before dispersal. The present paper provides a careful derivation of the equilib- rium sex ratio under this model in both diploid and haplo-diploid popu- lations, and extends the model to consider the effects of having a finite number of patches. We suggest that the equilibrium sex ratio is not simply a function of the amount of inbreeding or sib-mating, as suggested by Maynard Smith (1978), but that the detailed breeding structure of the population must be taken into account},

Thus, over time, the strategy mix should evolve to some type of optimal or stable state. Maynard Smith and Price (1973) have introduced the concept of ESS (evolutionarily stable strategy) to describe a stable state of the game. We attempt to model the dynamics of the game both in the continuous case, with a system of non-linear first-order differen- tial equations, and in the discrete case, with a system of non-linear difference equations. Using this model, we look at the notions of stability and asymptotic behavior. Our notion of stable equilibrium for the continuous dynamic includes, but is somewhat more general than, the notion of ESS.},

abstract = {Dispersal plays a crucial role in a range of evolutionary and ecological processes; hence there is strong motivation to understand its evolution. One key prediction is that the relative benefits of dispersal should be greater when dispersing away from close relatives, because in this case dispersal has the additional benefit of alleviating competition with individuals who share the same dispersal alleles. We tested this prediction for the first time using experimental populations of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We measured the fitness of isogenic genotypes that differed only in their dispersal behaviors in both clonal and mixed populations. Consistent with theory, the benefit of dispersal was much higher in clonal populations, and this benefit decreased with increasing growth rate costs associated with dispersal.},

This observation has been explained as a consequence of ubiquitous dispersal caused by the enormous population sizes of microbial species. Recently, this "everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects" theory has been challenged by the detection of considerable regional genetic variability within microbial morphospecies. We demonstrate that, contrary to what is expected under ubiquitous dispersal, evidence of regional-scale metacommunity processes can be detected in microbial morphospecies. Our results imply that the microbial and macrobial world are structured by analogous processes.},

We conducted a 300-day 15N field tracer experiment to determine how N moves through soil, microbial, and plant pools under different tree species and fertilization regimes. Samples were collected from single-species plots of American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L.), red oak (Quercus rubra L.), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh). Using paired plots we compared the effects of ambient levels of N inputs (11 kg N/ha/y) to additions of 50 kg N/ha/y that began 1.5 years prior to and continued throughout this experiment. Total plot 15N recovery (litter layer, organic and mineral soil to 12 cm, fine roots, and aboveground biomass) did not vary significantly among tree species, but the distribution of sinks for 15N within the forest ecosystem did vary. Recovery in the forest floor was significantly lower in sugar maple stands compared to the other species. 15Nitrogen recovery was 22{\%} lower in the fertilized plots compared to the ambient plots and red oak stands had the largest drop in 15N recovery as a result of N fertilization. Aboveground biomass became a significantly greater 15N sink with fertilization, although it retained less than 1{\%} of the tracer addition. These results indicate that different forest types vary in the amount of N retention in the forest floor, and that forest N retention may change depending upon N inputs. {\textcopyright} 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

abstract = {Abstract: Coevolution-reciprocal evolutionary change in interacting species-is one of the central biological processes organizing the web of life, and most species are involved in one or more coevolved interactions. We have learned in recent years that coevolution is a highly dynamic process that continually reshapes interactions among species across ecosystems, creating geographic mosaics over timescales sometimes as short as thousands or even hundreds of years. If we take that as our starting point, what should we now be asking about the coevolutionary process? Here I suggest five major questions that we need to answer if we are to understand how coevolution shapes the web of life. How evolutionarily dynamic is specialization to other species, and what is the role of coevolutionary alternation in driving those dynamics? Does the geographic mosaic of coevolution shape adaptation in fundamentally different ways in different forms of interaction? How does the geographic mosaic of coevolution shape speciation? How does the structure of reciprocal selection change during the assembly of large webs of interacting species? How important are genomic events such as whole-genome duplication (i.e., polyploidy) and whole-genome capture (i.e., hybridization) in generating novel webs of interacting species? I end by suggesting four points about coevolution that we should tell every new student or researcher in biology.},

abstract = {Studies seeking to explain local patterns of diversity have typically relied on niche explanations, reflected in correlations with local environmental conditions, or neutral theory, invoking dispersal processes and speciation. We used macroinvertebrate community data from 10 streams that varied independently in local ecological conditions and spatial proximity. Neutral theory predicts that similarity in communities will be negatively associated with distance between sites, while niche theory suggests that community similarity will be positively associated with similarity in local ecological conditions. Similarity in total invertebrate, grazer and predator assemblages showed negative relationships with distance and, for grazers and predators, positive relationships with local ecological conditions. However, the best model predicting community similarity in all three cases included aspects of both local ecological conditions and distance between sites. When assemblages were analysed according to dispersal ability, high-dispersal species were shown to be freely accessing all sites and community similarity was not well predicted by either local ecology or spatial separation. Assemblages of species with low and moderate dispersal ability were best predicted by combined models, including distance between sites and local ecological factors. The results suggest that the perceived dichotomy between neutral and local environmental processes in determining local patterns of diversity may not be useful. Neutral and niche processes structured these communities differentially depending on trophic level and species traits. We emphasize the potential for both dispersal processes and local environmental conditions to explain local patterns of diversity.},

abstract = {We propose an integrated, heuristic model of lotic biocomplexity across spatiotemporal scales from headwaters to large rivers. This riverine ecosystem synthesis (RES) provides a framework for understanding both broad, often discontinuous patterns along longitudinal and lateral dimensions of river networks and local ecological patterns across various temporal and smaller spatial scales. Rather than posing a completely new model, we arrange a conceptual marriage of eco-geomorphology (ecological aspects of fluvial geomorphology) with a terrestrial landscape model describing hierarchical patch dynamics. We modify five components of this terrestrial model for lotic ecosystems: (1) nested, discontinuous hierarchies of patch mosaics; (2) ecosystem dynamics as a composite of intra- and inter-patch dynamics; (3) linked patterns and processes; (4) dominance of non-equilibria] and stochastic processes; and (5) formation of a quasi-equilibrial, metastable state. Our conceptual model blends our perspectives on biocomplexity with aspects of aquatic models proposed from 1980-2004. Contrasting with a common view of rivers as continuous, longitudinal gradients in physical conditions, the RES portrays rivers as downstream arrays of large hydrogeomorphic patches (e.g. constricted, braided and floodplain channel areas) formed by catchment geomorphology and climate. The longitudinal distribution of these patches, which are identifiable using standard geomorphic techniques, varies amongst rivers and is difficult to forecast above ecoregional scales. Some types of hydrogeomorphic patches may reoccur along this downstream passage. Unique ecological 'functional process zones' are formed by individual types of hydrogeomorphic patches because of physiochemical habitat differences which affect ecosystem structure and function. The RES currently includes 14 tenets predicting how patterns of individual species distributions, community regulation, lotic ecosystem processes, and floodplain interactions will vary over spatiotemporal scales, especially as they relate to the functional process zones formed by hydrogeomorphic differences in the river network.

abstract = {All organisms, esecially terrestrial plants and other sessile species, interact mainly with their neighbors, but neighborhoods can differ in composition because of dispersal and mortality. There is increasingly strong evidence that the spatial structure created by these forces profoundly influences the dynamics, composition, and biodiversity of communities. Nonspatial models predict that no more consumer species can coexist at equilibrium than there are limiting resources. In contrast, a similar model that includes neighborhood competition and random dispersal among sites predicts stable coexistence of a potentially unlimited number of species on a single resource. Coexistence cocurs because species with sufficiently high dispersal rates persist in sites not occupied by surperior competitors. Coexistence requires limiting similarity and two-way or three-way interspecific trade-offs among competitive ability, colonization ability and longevity. This spatial competition hypothesis seems to explain the coexistence of the numerous plant species that compete for a single limiting resource in the grasslands of Cedar Creek Natural History Area. It provides a testable, alternative explanation for other high diversity communities, such as tropical forests. The model can be tested (1) by determining if coexisting species have the requisite trade-offs in colonization, competition, and longevity, (2) by addition of propagules to determine if local species abundances are limited by dispersal, and (3) by comparisons of the effects on biodiversity of high rates of propagule addition for species that differ in competitive ability.},

abstract = {This paper uses theory and experiments to explore the effects of diversity on stability, productivity, and susceptibility to invasion. A model of resource competition predicts that increases in diversity cause com- munity stability to increase, but population stability to decrease. These opposite effects are, to a great extent, explained by how temporal variances in species abundances scale with mean abundance, and by the differential impact of this scaling on population vs. community stability. Community stability also depends on a negative covariance effect (competitive compensation) and on overyielding (ecosystem productivity increasing with diversity). A long-term study in Minnesota grasslands supports these predictions. Models of competition predict, and ﬁeld experiments conﬁrm, that greater plant diversity leads to greater primary productivity. This diversity–productivity relationship results both from the greater chance that a more productive species would be present at higher diversity (the sampling effect) and from the better ‘‘coverage'' of habitat heterogeneity caused by the broader range of species traits in a more diverse community (the niche differentiation effect). Both effects cause more complete utilization of limiting resources at higher diversity, which increases resource retention, further increasing productivity. Finally, lower levels of available limiting resources at higher diversity are predicted to decrease the susceptibility of an ecosystem to invasion, supporting the diversity–invasibility hypothesis. This mechanism provides rules for community assembly and invasion resistance. In total, biodiversity should be added to species composition, disturbance, nutrient supply, and climate as a major controller of population and ecosystem dynamics and structure. By their increasingly great directional impacts on all of these controllers, humans are likely to cause major long-term changes in the functioning of ecosystems worldwide. A better understanding of these ecosystem changes is needed if ecologists are to provide society with the knowledge essential for wise management of the earth and its biological resources.},

The shape of the resource-dependent growth isocline of a species is used to classify resources as either (1) essential, (2) substitutable, or (3) hemi-essential. Essential resources are further classified as being either interactive or noninteractive. Substitutable re- sources- are classified as being either complementary, perfectly substitutable, antagonistic, or switching. I then derive a simple graphical technique that allows prediction of the out- comes of consumer-resource interactions when numerous species compete for two resources.},

abstract = {The relationships between biodiversity and stability were determined for both population and ecosystem traits in a long-term study of 207 grassland plots. Results demonstrate that biodiversity stabilizes community and ecosystem processes, but not population processes. Specifically, year-to-year variability in total aboveground plant community biomass was significantly lower in plots with greater plant species richness both for the entire 11-yr period and for the nine non-drought years. The change in total plant community biomass from before the drought to the peak of the drought was also highly dependent on species richness. For all three measures of total community biomass stability, multiple regressions that controlled for covariates showed similar significant relationships between plant diversity and stability. In contrast, year-to-year variability in species abundances was not stabilized by plant species richness for either all years or non-drought years. This difference between species vs. community biomass likely results from interspecific competition. When climatic variations harm some species, unharmed competitors increase. Such compensatory increases stabilize total community biomass, but cause species abundances to be more variable. These results support both the predictions of Robert May concerning the effects of diversity on population stability and the diversity-stability hypothesis as applied to community and ecosystem processes, thus helping to reconcile a long-standing dispute.},

abstract = {Stochastic niche theory resolves many of the differences between neutral theory and classical tradeoff-based niche theories of resource competition and community structure. In stochastic niche theory, invading species become established only if propagules can survive stochastic mortality while growing to maturity on the resources left unconsumed by established species. The theory makes three predictions about community structure. First, stochastic niche assembly creates communities in which species dominate approximately equally wide "slices" of the habitat's spatial heterogeneity. These niche widths generate realistic distributions of species relative abundances for which, contrary to neutral theory but consistent with numerous observations, there are strong correlations among species traits, species abundances, and environmental conditions. Second, slight decreases in resource levels are predicted to cause large decreases in the probability that a propagule would survive to be an adult. These decreases cause local diversity to be limited by the inhibitory effects of resource use by established species on the establishment (recruitment) of potential invaders. If resource pulses or disturbance allowed invaders to overcome this recruitment limitation, many more species could indefinitely coexist. Third, the low invasibility of high diversity communities is predicted to result not from diversity per se, but from the uniformly low levels of resources that occur in high-diversity communities created by stochastic competitive assembly. This prediction provides a potential solution to the invasion paradox, which is the tendency for highly diverse regions to be more heavily invaded.},

abstract = {In 1982, experimental nitrogen gradients were established on both existing and disturbed (disked) vegetation in three fields (abandoned 14, 25, and 48 yr) and on existing vegetation in native oak savannah. Each of these seven gradients contained five or six replicates of each of nine treatments that differed in the annual rate of nitrogen addition. In none of the fields did plant biomass, height, species richness, or light penetration respond to addition of P, K, Ca, Mg, S, and trace metals. In contrast, plant biomass and height increased significantly, and light penetration and species richness decreased significantly, with added nitrogen along all seven gradients. On average, {\textgreater}60{\%} of the species had been displaced from high—nitrogen treatments by 1985. Nitrogen addition led to a period of transient dominance by certain species. Species that reached peak relative abundance in high—nitrogen treatments in 1982 tended to be rare in all but the low—nitrogen treatments by 1985. In contrast, the relative abundances of most species that dominated the high—nitrogen treatments in 1985 did not increase along the nitrogen gradients in 1982. The relative or absolute abundances of most common species changed significantly along the experimental gradients in at least 1 yr. By 1985, many common species were differentiated in their distributions along the seven gradients. In general, early successional annuals and short—lived perennials and plants of short stature at maturity reached their peak abundance in low—nitrogen plots, whereas plots, receiving high rates of nitrogen addition were dominated by long—lived herbaceous and woody species that are taller at maturity. A survey of 22 old fields at Cedar Creek, Minnesota, showed that total and available soil nitrogen increased during succession and that major species had individualistic, fairly Gaussian distributions along this temporal nitrogen gradient. The distributions along the experimental gradients of most of the common species were consistent with the pattern observed in the old—field survey, demonstrating that nitrogen influences the pattern of secondary succession at Cedar Creek. The major exception was Agropyron repens, and early successional grass that dominated high—nitrogen treatments on six of the seven gradients. Comparisons of species responses on the disturbed plots with those on plots of existing (undisturbed) vegetation showed that, by 1985, most species responded similarly to the nitrogen gradients despite great differences in their initial abundances. For instance, Agropyron repens, an initial dominant of Field A but rare in Fields B and C, was dominant in the high—nitrogen treatments in both the disturbed and undisturbed plots of these three fields. It invaded into and rapidly increased in abundance in numerous high—nitrogen plots from which it was initially absent. Schizachyrium scoparium declined along the nitrogen gradients both in undisked plots in which it was initially dominant and in disked plots in which it was initially rare. Such similarities suggest that the outcome of interspecific interactions among old—field plants is highly dependent on nitrogen supply rates, but fairly independent of initial plant abundances.

The two models that address plant nutrient competition also predict that ecosystem nutrient retention increases with biodiversity and that the effects of biodiversity on productivity and nutrient retention increase with interspecific differences in resource requirements. All three models show that both species identity and biodiversity simultaneously influence ecosystem functioning, but their relative importance varies greatly among the models.

Even moderate habitat destruction is predicted to cause time-delayed but deterministic extinction of the dominant competitor in remnant patches. Further species are predicted to become extinct, in order from the best to the poorest competitors, as habitat destruction increases. Moreover, the more fragmented a habitat already is, the greater is the number of extinctions caused by added destruction. Because such extinctions occur generations after fragmentation, they represent a debt-a future ecological cost of current habitat destruction.},

abstract = {Human-driven ecosystem simplification has highlighted questions about how the number of species in an ecosystem influences its functioning. Although biodiversity is now known to affect ecosystem productivity, its effects on stability are debated. Here we present a long-term experimental field test of the diversity-stability hypothesis. During a decade of data collection in an experiment that directly controlled the number of perennial prairie species, growing-season climate varied considerably, causing year-to-year variation in abundances of plant species and in ecosystem productivity. We found that greater numbers of plant species led to greater temporal stability of ecosystem annual aboveground plant production. In particular, the decadal temporal stability of the ecosystem, whether measured with intervals of two, five or ten years, was significantly greater at higher plant diversity and tended to increase as plots matured. Ecosystem stability was also positively dependent on root mass, which is a measure of perenniating biomass. Temporal stability of the ecosystem increased with diversity, despite a lower temporal stability of individual species, because of both portfolio (statistical averaging) and overyielding effects. However, we found no evidence of a covariance effect.

Diversity effects were neither transients nor explained solely by a few productive or unviable species. Rather, many higher-diversity plots outperformed the best monoculture. These results help resolve debate over biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, show effects at higher than expected diversity levels, and demonstrate, for these ecosystems, that even the best-chosen monocultures cannot achieve greater productivity or carbon stores than higher-diversity sites.},

abstract = {This paper examines the usage and measurement of “landscape connectivity” in 33 recent studies. Connectivity is defined as the degree to which a landscape facilitates or impedes movement of organisms among resource patches. However, connectivity is actually used in a variety of ways in the literature. This has led to confusion and lack of clarity related to (1) function vs structure, (2) patch isolation vs landscape connectivity and, (3) corridors vs connectivity. We suggest the term connectivity should be reserved for its original purpose. We highlight nine studies; these include modeling studies that actually measured connectivity in accordance with the definition, and empirical studies that measured key components of connectivity. We found that measurements of connectivity provide results that can be interpreted as recommending habitat fragmentation to enhance landscape connectivity. We discuss reasons for this misleading conclusion, and suggest a new way of quantifying connectivity, which avoids this problem. We also recommend a method for reducing sampling intensity in landscape-scale empirical studies of connectivity.},

abstract = {The elements of metacommunity structure (EMS) framework gives rise to important ecological insights through the distinction of metacommunities into several different idealised structures. We examined the EMS in assemblages occupying a low-mountain river system in central Germany, sampled over three consecutive years. We compared the idealised distributions of assemblages in both the riparian floodplain zone (carabid beetles and spiders) and the benthic instream environment (benthic invertebrates). We further deconstructed instream organisms into taxonomic and trait groups to examine whether greater signal emerges in more similar species groups. We found little evidence of strong competition, even for trait-modality groups, and nestedness was almost non-existent. In addition to random distributions, Gleasonian distributions (indicating clear, but individualistic turnover between sites) were the most commonly identified structure. Clear differences were apparent between different trait groups, particularly between within-trait modalities. These were most evident for different dispersal modes and life cycle durations, with strong dispersers showing possible signs of mass effects. While random distributions may have partly reflected small sample sizes, clearly coherent patterns were evident for many groups, indicating a sufficient gradient in environmental conditions. The prevalence of random distributions suggests many species are responding to a variety of environmental filters in these river-floodplain metacommunities in an anthropogenically-dominated landscape, whereas Gleasonian distributions indicate species are responding idiosyncratically to a primary environmental gradient. Our findings further emphasise the prevalence of context dependency (spatio-temporal variability) in metacommunity studies, thus we stress the need to further disentangle the causes of such variation.},

abstract = {{\{}{\textless}{\}}p{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}Understanding factors that structure regional biodiversity is important for linking ecological and biogeographic processes. Our objective was to explore regional patterns in riverine benthic invertebrate assemblages in relation to their broad positioning along the river network and examine differences in composition, biodiversity (alpha and beta diversity), and environmental drivers. We up-scaled methods used to examine patterns in metacommunity structure (Elements of Metacommunity Structure framework) to examine faunal distribution patterns at the regional extent for 168 low-mountain stream invertebrate assemblages in central Germany. We then identified the most influential environmental factors using boosted regression trees. Faunal composition patterns were compartmentalised (Clementsian or quasi-Clementsian), with little difference from headwaters to large rivers, potentially reflecting the regional scale of the study, by crossing major catchment boundaries and incorporating different species pools. While idealised structures did not vary, environmental drivers of composition varied considerably between river sections and with alpha diversity. Prediction was substantially weaker, and the importance of space was greater, in large rivers compared to other sections suggesting a weakening in species sorting downstream. Further, there was a stronger transition in composition than for alpha diversity downstream. The stronger links with regional faunal composition than with richness further emphasises the importance of considering the alternative ways in which anthropogenic stressors are operating to affect biodiversity patterns. Our approach allowed bridging the gap between local (or metacommunity) and regional scales, providing key insights into drivers of regional biodiversity patterns.{\{}{\textless}{\}}/p{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}},

Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon for June of 1992 and 1993. Two adjacent research plots were sampled: one plot consisted of a heterogeneous mix of age classes with a high density of old-growth Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii); the other plot was dominated by a homogeneous post-fire stand of Douglas-fir regrowth with a low density of old-growth trees. Spatial analysis revealed distinguishable differences between old growth and regrowth forest and between sampled years. In the hot dry spring of 1992, short range variability and patches (0 to 5 m), especially in pH, moisture, O-horizon depth, and faunal census, were more pronounced in the homogeneous regrowth plot, whereas long range patterns (17 to 22 m) were more pronounced in the heterogeneous old growth plot. In the cold wet spring of 1993 both old growth and regrowth forest plots had only short range variation.},

We conducted a systematic literature search of research directed towards understanding factors that influence biodiversity in lotic habitats, published in 31 major ecological and freshwater science journals from 1981 to 2014. Our goal was to characterize emergent themes in research successes and identify important areas in need of study. We show an overwhelming taxonomic bias favoring studies of macroinvertebrates and fish, and a paucity in studies of other important groups such as bacteria and fungi. While most studies assessed habitat variables that affect diversity at a local scale, there has been a recent push to investigate regional drivers of beta and gamma diversity. Several factors were consistently found to be important drivers of diversity including local habitat type, hydrologic variables, disturbance, and stream morphometry. Others such as nutrients and chemical variables showed mixed support. Species interactions, dispersal, and evolutionary processes were rarely considered but show promise as fruitful areas for future study. We suggest that researchers should give increased attention to diversity drivers at different scales as well as take advantage of new molecular techniques to address questions regarding organismal diversity in streams.},

Here, we investigate how dispersal rate evolves in response to habitat persistence, mean habitat availability and landscape pattern. We show that dispersal rate is generally lowered by reduced habitat availability and by longer habitat persistence. However, for habitats that persist for an average of ten times the length of a generation, we show a clear non-monotonic relationship between habitat availability and dispersal rate. Some patterns of available habitat result in populations with dispersal polymorphisms. We explain these observations as a metapopulation effect, with the rate of evolution a function of both within-population and between-population selection pressures. Individuals in corridors evolve much lower dispersal rates than those in the mainland populations, especially within long, narrow corridors. We consider the implications of the results for conservation.},

The authors regrouped the data used in these empirical models to eliminate the potential biases introduced by including data from lakes not in dynamic equilibrium and generated a new model based on TP. This new model accounted for 11{\%} more of the variation in relative blue-green algal biomass than the original model based on TN, TP, SD, and Z sub(m) and 21{\%} more than the model based on TN to TP ratios and SD to Z sub(m) ratios. This new model was also a much better predictor of the relative biomass of blue-green algae in Alberta lakes than the original models. The analyses suggest that for large numbers of lakes, TP may be as good or better an indicator of relative and total biomass of blue-green algae than TN or TN to TP ratios.},

All material entering the stream channel was presumed to enter the water sometime during the year. Material estimates are based on total channel area. The major annual nitrogen input (1974-1975) was subsurface flow (11.06 g/m{\^{}}2) as dissolved organic nitrogen (10.56 g/m{\^{}}2) and nitrate (0.50 g/m{\^{}}2).Biological inputs of nitrogen amounted to 4.19 g/m{\^{}}2 as direct terrestrial inputs of: litterfall (1.35 g/m{\^{}}2), lateral movement (1.78 g/m{\^{}}2), and throughfall (0.30 g/m{\^{}}2). Nitrogen fixation on fine wood debris contributed an additional 0.76 g/m{\^{}}2 based on rates from a nearby watershed. Total nitrogen input was 15.25 g/m{\^{}}2. The nitrogen pool was dominated by large amounts of particulate organic matter. Coarse wood constituted 32{\%} of the nitrogen pool (3.80 g/m{\^{}}2) and fine wood fractions 18{\%} (2.18 g/m{\^{}}2). The coarse wood fraction greatly influenced stream morphology. Fine organic particulates constituted an additional 40{\%} of the nitrogen pool (4.77 g/m{\^{}}2). DON (dissolved organic nitrogen) export (8.38 g/m{\^{}}2) was less than input, presumably due to biological uptake associated with litter mineralization, sorption, and chemical flocculation. Due to effective retention of particulate inputs by debris dams, biological processing in the particulate nitrogen pool, and uptake and sorption of DON, most particulate organic inputs increased in nitrogen concentration prior to export. Particulate organic nitrogen input (3.13 g/m{\^{}}2) was greater than export (2.53 g/m{\^{}}2). Total annual nitrogen output was 11.36 g/m{\^{}}2, resulting in a gain of 3.89 g@?m{\^{}}-{\^{}}2@?yr{\^{}}-{\^{}}1 to the stream. Thus, the stream was not operating on an annual steady state, but on an input-output regime related to the processing of refractory wood debris and resetting by major storms. Although particulate and dissolved nitrogen loss per hectare was small for the 10-ha watershed, these losses passed through or were accumulated in a pool encompassing {\textless}1{\%} of the watershed area. This concentration of N in the stream allowed establishment of a separate ecosystem whose processing efficiency and capabilities for nutrient cycling were related to the retention capacity of the channel and nutrient quality of inputs within the reach.},

abstract = {The subsurface riparian zone was examined as an ecotone with two interfaces. Inland is a terrestrial boundary, where transport of water and dissolved solutes is toward the channel and controlled by watershed hydrology. Streamside is an aquatic boundary, where exchange of surface water and dissolved solutes is bi-directional and flux is strongly influenced by channel hydraulics. Streamside, bi-directional exchange of water was qualitatively defined using biologically conservative tracers in a third order stream. In several experiments, penetration of surface water extended 18 m inland. Travel time of water from the channel to bankside sediments was highly variable. Subsurface chemical gradients were indirectly related to the travel time. Sites with long travel times tended to be low in nitrate and DO (dissolved oxygen) but high in ammonium and DOC (dissolved organic carbon). Sites with short travel times tended to be high in nitrate and DO but low in ammonium and DOC. Ammonium concentration of interstitial water also was influenced by sorption-desorption processes that involved clay minerals in hyporheic sediments. Denitrification potential in subsurface sediments increased with distance from the channel, and was limited by nitrate at inland sites and by DO in the channel sediments. Conversely, nitrification potential decreased with distance from the channel, and was limited by DO at inland sites and by ammonium at channel locations. Advection of water and dissolved oxygen away from the channel resulted in an oxidized subsurface habitat equivalent to that previously defined as the hyporheic zone. The hyporheic zone is viewed as stream habitat because of its high proportion of surface water and the occurrence of channel organisms. Beyond the channel's hydrologic exchange zone, interstitial water is often chemically reduced. Interstitial water that has not previously entered the channel, groundwater, is viewed as a terrestrial component of the riparian ecotone. Thus, surface water habitats may extend under riparian vegetation, and terrestrial groundwater habitats may be found beneath the stream channel.},

abstract = {The order of species arrival during community assembly can greatly affect species coexistence, but the strength of these effects, known as priority effects, appears highly variable across species and ecosystems. Furthermore, the causes of this variation remain unclear despite their fundamental importance in understanding species coexistence. Here, we show that one potential cause is environmental variability. In laboratory experiments using nectar-inhabiting microorganisms as a model system, we manipulated spatial and temporal variability of temperature, and examined consequences for priority effects. If species arrived sequentially, multiple species coexisted under variable temperature, but not under constant temperature. Temperature variability prevented extinction of late-arriving species that would have been excluded owing to priority effects if temperature had been constant. By contrast, if species arrived simultaneously, species coexisted under both variable and constant temperatures. We propose possible mechanisms underlying these results using a mathematical model that incorporates contrasting effects of microbial species on nectar pH and amino acids. Overall, our findings suggest that understanding consequences of priority effects for species coexistence requires explicit consideration of environmental variability.},

abstract = {The prevailing terminological confusion around the concept 'diversity' has hampered accurate communication and caused diversity issues to appear unnecessarily complicated. In fact, a consistent terminology for phenomena related to (species) diversity is already available. When this terminology is adhered to, diversity emerges as an easily understood concept. It is important to differentiate between diversity itself and a diversity index: an index of something is just a surrogate for the thing itself. The conceptual problem of defining diversity also has to be separated from the practical problem of deciding how to adequately quantify diversity for a community of interest. In practice, diversity can be quantified for any dataset where units of observation (such as individuals) have been classified into types (such as species). All that needs to be known is what proportion of the observed units belong to a type of mean abundance. Diversity equals the inverse of this mean, and it quantifies the effective number of the types of interest. In ecology, interest often (but not always) focuses on species diversity. If the dataset consists of (or gets divided into) subunits, then the total effective number of species (gamma diversity) can be partitioned into the effective number of compositionally distinct subunits (beta diversity) and the mean effective number of species per such subunit (alpha diversity). Species richness is related to species diversity, but they are not the same thing; richness does not take the proportional abundances into account and is therefore the actual-rather than the effective-number of types. Most of the phenomena that have been called 'beta diversity' in the past do not quantify an effective number of types, so they should be referred to by names other than 'diversity' (for example, species turnover or differentiation).},

abstract = {Ecologists widely agree that species diversity consists of two components, richness (the number of species) and evenness (a measure of the equitability of the proportional abundances of those species). However, no consensus on an exact definition of evenness (or equitability) has emerged. Instead, numerous equitability indices have been used in the ecological literature, as different researchers have preferred indices with different mathematical properties. In this paper, I show that the phrase ‘species diversity consists of two independent components, richness and evenness' logically leads to one particular definition of evenness (Evenness = Diversity/Richness). To facilitate accurate communication, I propose that the term ‘evenness' be used only to refer to this phenomenon, and that other terms be used for the equitability indices that measure other things. Here I provide a review of popular equitability indices, explain what each measures in practice, and show how they relate to each other and to evenness itself. I also explore how the partitioning of diversity into richness and evenness components is related to the partitioning of diversity into alpha and beta components. Dissecting the indices makes it easier to see the conceptual differences among them. Such understanding is necessary to ensure that an appropriate index is chosen for the questions at hand, as well as to interpret the index values correctly and to assess when index values can and when they cannot be considered comparable.},

abstract = {Many studies have attempted to disentangle the effects of neutral and niche-mediated processes on community composition using partial Mantel tests and variance partitioning on dissimilarity matrices. Recently, doubts about the reliability of these methods have emerged. Here we explore how the results are affected by three confounding factors that may affect ecological data to different degrees: spatial autocorrelation of the environmental variables, length of the compositional gradient, and sampling noise. We document that the statistical hypotheses tested in these methods may or may not correspond to the ecological hypotheses of interest. A major discrepancy emerges if a large proportion of sampling units in the analysed dataset share no species, in which case compositional dissimilarities saturate to a fixed maximum value although explanatory dissimilarities do not. With increasing dissimilarity saturation, the explanatory power of regression models decrease, which may lead to the erroneous conclusion that the ecological processes represented by the explanatory variables are not operating. A survey of recent literature suggests that there is a general lack of awareness of this problem, although it appears to affect {\textgreater} 10{\%} of relevant studies. Our simulations show that if dissimilarity saturation is due to a long ecological gradient, extended dissimilarities essentially solve the problem for any degree of saturation. Using distances from a hybrid multidimensional scaling alleviates the saturation problem when the degree of saturation is {\textless} 60{\%}. However, neither correction method can provide a solution to problems caused by insufficient sampling. How the presence of multiple explanatory gradients in combination with sampling noise affects overall analysis performance remains to be clarified.},

abstract = {General principles from coexistence theory are often invoked to explain how and why mixtures of species outperform monocultures. However, the complementarity and selection effects commonly measured in biodiversity experiments do not precisely quantify the niche and relative fitness differences that govern species coexistence. Given this lack of direct correspondence, how can we know whether species-rich mixtures are stable and that the benefits of diversity will therefore persist? We develop a resource-based included-niche model in which plant species have asymmetric access to a nested set of belowground resource pools. We use the model to show that positive complementarity effects arise from stabilising niche differences, but do not necessarily lead to stable coexistence and hence can be transient. In addition, these transient complementarity effects occur in the model when there is no complementary resource use among species. Including a trade-off between uptake rates and the size of the resource pool stabilised interactions and led to persistent complementarity coupled with weak or negative selection effects, consistent with results from the longest-running field biodiversity experiments. We suggest that future progress requires a greater mechanistic understanding of the links between ecosystem functions and their underlying biological processes.},

This paper synthesizes current understanding of disturbance with an emphasis on fundamental contributions to contemporary landscape and ecosystem ecology, then identifies future research priorities. Studies of disturbance led to insights about heterogeneity, scale, and thresholds in space and time and catalyzed new paradigms in ecology. Because they create vegetation patterns, disturbances also establish spatial patterns of many ecosystem processes on the landscape. Drivers of global change will produce new spatial patterns, altered disturbance regimes, novel trajectories of change, and surprises. Future disturbances will continue to provide valuable opportunities for studying pattern–process interactions. Changing disturbance regimes will produce acute changes in ecosystems and ecosystem services over the short (years to decades) and long term (centuries and beyond). Future research should address questions related to (1) disturbances as catalysts of rapid ecological change, (2) interactions among disturbances, (3) relationships between disturbance and society, especially the intersection of land use and disturbance, and (4) feedbacks from disturbance to other global drivers.

We highlighted three case studies from Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network sites that have contributed to understanding the causes and consequences of disturbance in ecological systems. The LTER Network significantly enhances the ability to study disturbance by (a) encompassing ecosystems subject to a wide range of disturbances, (b) providing a long-term baseline against which to detect change and measure ecosystem responses to disturbance, (c) permitting observation of slow or infrequent events, (d) facilitating the use of multiple research approaches, (e) providing a focus for modeling disturbance dynamics, and (f) contributing to land and resource management. Long-term research is crucial to understanding past, present, and future disturbance dynamics, and the LTER Network is poised to make continuing contributions to the understanding of disturbance.},

abstract = {Nestedness analysis has become increasingly popular in the study of biogeographic patterns of species occurrence. Nested patterns are those in which the species composition of small assemblages is a nested subset of larger assemblages. For species interaction networks such as plant-pollinator webs, nestedness analysis has also proven a valuable tool for revealing ecological and evolutionary constraints. Despite this popularity, there has been substantial controversy in the literature over the best methods to define and quantify nestedness, and how to test for patterns of nestedness against an appropriate statistical null hypothesis. Here we review this rapidly developing literature and provide suggestions and guidelines for proper analyses. We focus on the logic and the performance of different metrics and the proper choice of null models for statistical inference. We observe that traditional 'gap-counting' metrics are biased towards species loss among columns (occupied sites) and that many metrics are not invariant to basic matrix properties. The study of nestedness should be combined with an appropriate gradient analysis to infer possible causes of the observed presence-absence sequence. In our view, statistical inference should be based on a null model in which row and columns sums are fixed. Under this model, only a relatively small number of published empirical matrices are significantly nested. We call for a critical reassessment of previous studies that have used biased metrics and unconstrained null models for statistical inference.},

abstract = {SynthesisThe identification of distinctive patterns in species x site presence-absence matrices is important for understanding meta-community organisation. We compared the performance of a suite of null models and metrics that have been proposed to measure patterns of segregation, aggregation, nestedness, coherence, and species turnover. We found that any matrix with segregated species pairs can be re-ordered to highlight aggregated pairs, indicating that these seemingly opposite patterns are closely related. Recently proposed classification schemes failed to correctly classify realistic matrices that included multiple co-occurrence structures. We propose using a combination of metrics and decomposing matrix-wide patterns into those of individual pairs of species and sites to pinpoint sources of non-randomness.Null model analysis has been a popular tool for detecting pattern in binary presence–absence matrices, and previous tests have identified algorithms and metrics that have good statistical properties. However, the behavior of different metrics is often correlated, making it difficult to distinguish different patterns. We compared the performance of a suite of null models and metrics that have been proposed to measure patterns of segregation, aggregation, nestedness, coherence, and species turnover. We found that any matrix with segregated species pairs can be re-ordered to highlight aggregated pairs. As a consequence, the same null model can identify a single matrix as being simultaneously aggregated, segregated or nested. These results cast doubt on previous conclusions of matrix-wide species segregation based on the C-score and the fixed-fixed algorithm. Similarly, we found that recently proposed classification schemes based on patterns of coherence, nestedness, and segregation and aggregation cannot be uniquely distinguished using proposed metrics and null model algorithms. It may be necessary to use a combination of different metrics and to decompose matrix-wide patterns into those of individual pairs of species or pairs of sites to pinpoint the sources of non-randomness.},

abstract = {Two opposing patterns of meta-community organization are nestedness and negative species co-occurrence. Both patterns can be quantified with metrics that are applied to presence-absence matrices and tested with null model analysis. Previous meta-analyses have given conflicting results, with the same set of matrices apparently showing high nestedness (Wright et al. 1998) and negative species co-occurrence (Gotelli and McCabe 2002). We clarified the relationship between nestedness and co-occurrence by creating random matrices, altering them systematically to increase or decrease the degree of nestedness or co-occurrence, and then testing the resulting patterns with null models. Species co-occurrence is related to the degree of nestedness, but the sign of the relationship depends on how the test matrices were created. Low-fill matrices created by simple, uniform sampling generate negative correlations between nestedness and co-occurrence: negative species co-occurrence is associated with disordered matrices. However, high-fill matrices created by passive sampling generate the opposite pattern: negative species co-occurrence is associated with highly nested matrices. The patterns depend on which index of species co-occurrence is used, and they are not symmetric: systematic changes in the co-occurrence structure of a matrix are only weakly associated with changes in the pattern of nestedness. In all analyses, the fixed-fixed null model that preserves matrix row and column totals has lower type I and type II error probabilities than an equiprobable null model that relaxes row and column totals. The latter model is part of the popular nestedness temperature calculator, which detects nestedness too frequently in random matrices (type I statistical error). When compared to a valid null model, a matrix with negative species co-occurrence may be either highly nested or disordered, depending on the biological processes that determine row totals (number of species occurrences) and column totals (number of species per site)},

abstract = {Theory on plant succession predicts a temporal increase in the complexity of spatial community structure and of competitive interactions: initially random occurrences of early colonising species shift towards spatially and competitively structured plant associations in late successional stages. Here we use long-term data on early plant succession in a German post mining area to disentangle the importance of random colonisation, habitat filtering, and competition on the temporal and spatial development of plant community structure. We used species co-occurrence analysis and a recently developed method for assessing competitive strength and hierarchies (transitive versus intransitive competitive orders) in multispecies communities. We found that species turnover decreased through time within interaction neighbourhoods, but increased through time outside interaction neighbourhoods. Successional change did not lead to modular community structure. After accounting for species richness effects, the strength of competitive interactions and the proportion of transitive competitive hierarchies increased through time. Although effects of habitat filtering were weak, random colonization and subsequent competitive interactions had strong effects on community structure. Because competitive strength and transitivity were poorly correlated with soil characteristics, there was little evidence for context dependent competitive strength associated with intransitive competitive hierarchies.},

abstract = {Ecologists are familiar with two data structures commonly used to represent landscapes. Vector-based maps delineate land cover types as polygons, while raster lattices represent the landscape as a grid. Here we adopt a third lattice data structure, the graph. A graph represents a landscape as a set of nodes (e.g., habitat patches) connected to some degree by edges that join pairs of nodes functionally (e.g., via dispersal). Graph theory is well developed in other fields, including geography (transportation networks, routing ap- plications, siting problems) and computer science (circuitry and network optimization).We present an overview of basic elements of graph theory as it might be applied to issues of connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes, focusing especially on applications of metapo- pulation theory in conservation biology. We develop a general set of analyses using a hypothetical landscape mosaic of habitat patches in a nonhabitat matrix. Our results suggest that a simple graph construct, the minimum spanning tree, can serve as a powerful guide to decisions about the relative importance of individual patches to overall landscape con- nectivity. We then apply this approach to an actual conservation scenario involving the threatened Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis lucida). Simulations with an incidence- function metapopulation model suggest that population persistence can be maintained de- spite substantial losses of habitat area, so long as the minimum spanning tree is protected. We believe that graph theory has considerable promise for applications concerned with connectivity and ecological flows in general. Because the theory is already well developed in other disciplines, it might be brought to bear immediately on pressing ecological ap- plications in conservation biology and landscape ecology.},

abstract = {Longstanding theory in behavioral ecology predicts that prey should evolve decreased foraging rates under high predation threat. However, an alternative perspective suggests that growth into a size refuge from gape-limited predation and the future benefits of large size can outweigh the initial survival costs of intense foraging. Here, I evaluate the relative contributions of selection from a gape-limited predator (Ambystoma opacum) and spatial location to explanations of variation in foraging, growth, and survival in 10 populations of salamander larvae (Ambystoma maculatum). Salamander larvae from populations naturally exposed to intense A. opacum predation risk foraged more actively under common garden conditions. Higher foraging rates were associated with low survival in populations exposed to free-ranging A. opacum larvae. Results demonstrate that risky foraging activity can evolve in high predation-risk habitats when the dominant predators are gape-limited. This finding invites the further exploration of diverse patterns of prey foraging behavior that depends on natural variation in predator size-selectivity. In particular, prey should adopt riskier behaviors under predation threat than expected under existing risk allocation models if foraging effort directly reduces the duration of risk by growth into a size refuge. Moreover, evidence from this study suggests that foraging has evolved over microgeographic scales despite substantial modification by regional gene flow. This interaction between local selection and spatial location suggests a joint role for adaptation and maladaptation in shaping species interactions across natural landscapes, which is a finding with implications for dynamics at the population, community, and metacommunity levels.},

abstract = {Given the potential for rapid and microgeographical adaptation, ecologists increasingly are exploring evolutionary explanations for community patterns. Biotic selection can generate local adaptations that alter species interactions. Although some gene flow might be necessary to fuel local adaptation, higher gene flow can homogenise traits across regions and generate local maladaptation. Herein, I estimate the contributions of local biotic selection, gene flow and spatially autocorrelated biotic selection to among-population divergence in traits involved in species interactions across 75 studies. Local biotic selection explained 6.9{\%} of inter-population trait divergence, an indirect estimate of restricted gene flow explained 0.1{\%}, and spatially autocorrelated selection explained 9.3{\%}. Together, biotic selection explained 16{\%} of the variance in population trait means. Most biotic selection regimes were spatially autocorrelated. Hence, most populations receive gene flow from populations facing similar selection, which could allow for local adaptation despite moderate gene flow. Gene flow constrained adaptation in studies conducted at finer spatial scales as expected, but this effect was often confounded with spatially autocorrelated selection. Results indicate that traits involved in species interactions might often evolve across landscapes, especially when biotic selection is spatially autocorrelated. The frequent evolution of species interactions suggests that evolutionary processes might often influence community ecology.},

abstract = {Metacommunity theories predict multispecies coexistence based on the interplay between local species interactions and regional migration. To date, most metacommunity models implicitly assume that evolution can be ignored. Yet empirical studies indicate a substantial potential for contemporary evolution. I evaluate how evolution alters species diversity in a simulated mass-effects (sink-source) metacommunity. Populations inhabiting source habitats became locally adapted, while subordinate competitors became maladapted because of assumed ecological and phenotypic trade-offs between habitats. This maladaptation decreased and leveled relative abundances among subordinate populations. These two effects produced two regions of departure from nonevolutionary predictions. Assuming low proportional migration, maladaptation reduced local species richness via an overall reduction in reproductive rates in sink populations. With intermediate proportional migration, a greater absolute reduction of reproductive rates in intermediate competitors leveled reproductive rates and thereby enhanced local species richness. Although maladaptation is usually viewed as a constraint on species coexistence, simulations suggest that its effects on diversity are manifold and dependent on interpatch migration and community context. Hence, metacommunity predictions often may profit from an evolutionary perspective. Results indicate that modifications of community connectivity, such as might occur during habitat fragmentation, could elicit rapid shifts in communities from regions of high to low biodiversity.},

Results did not support the hypothesis that dispersal was limited by interpatch distance. Instead, community diversity, composition, and trophic structure were best ex- plained by local environmental variation associated with pond permanence. Many taxa were restricted either to temporary or semipermanent ponds, an outcome that suggests species trade off adaptations to disturbance with those to biotic interactions (species-sorting model) and that refutes the neutral model of interspecific equivalence. However, evidence for high dispersal rates, low-fitness habitats, and high temporal environmental variability indicated that interpatch dispersal also may influence local dynamics through mass effects. These results suggest that integrating the species-sorting and mass-effect niche assembly frame- works will provide a necessary step in the successful application of metacommunity theory.},

abstract = {The metacommunity framework predicts that local coexistence depends on the outcome of local species interactions and regional migration. In analogous fashion, spatial structure among populations can shape species interactions through evolutionary mechanisms. Yet, most metacommunity theories assume that populations do not evolve. Here, we evaluate how evolution shapes local species coexistence and exclusion within the multiscale and multispecies context embodied by the metacommunity framework. In general, coexistence in joint ecological–evolutionary models requires low to intermediate dispersal rates that can promote maintenance of both regional species and genetic diversity. These conditions support a set of key mechanisms that modify patterns of species coexistence including local adaptation, gene storage effects, genetic rescue effects, spatial genetic subsidies, and metacommunity evolution. Multispecies extensions indicate that correlated selection can further alter the outcome of interspecific interac...},

abstract = {Theories of forest succession predict a close relationship between net biomass increment and catchment nutrient retention. Retention, therefore, is expected to be greatest during aggrading phases of forest succession. In general, studies of this type have compared watershed retention efficiency by monitoring stream nutrient export at the base of the catchment. As such, streams are viewed only as transport systems. Contrary to this view, the nutrient spiraling concept emphasizes transformation and retention of nutrients within stream ecosystems. In this paper, we address how biogeochemical theory developed for forests may apply to lotic ecosystems in the context of catchment-level succession. Using measures of nutrient spiraling to document uptake, we focus on later seral stages by comparing streams draining second-growth (i.e., 75–100-yr stands) and old-growth (i.e., {\textgreater}400 yr) forests of the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA. Standing stocks of large woody debris (LWD) in old-growth streams were orders of magnitude greater than in second-growth streams where logging practices removed LWD from stream channels. Debris dams were also more frequent in old-growth streams. Solute injections were used to quantify retention of dissolved inorganic phosphate (PO4-P), the limiting nutrient in Appalachian streams. Uptake velocities in old-growth streams were significantly greater than in second-growth streams and were closely related to debris dam frequency, LWD volume, and the proportion of fine-grained ({\textless}2 mm) sediments present in the stream bed. These data suggest that streams of old-growth forests have greater demand for PO4-P compared to streams draining aggrading second-growth catchments. Finally, we present a schematic model of forest succession, aquatic–terrestrial interaction, and biogeochemical functioning in stream ecosystems emphasizing that the successional time course of retention in lotic ecosystems may be very different than that predicted for forests.},

abstract = {We address the ecological ramifications of variation in hydrologic interaction between streams and alluvial aquifers in catchments with alluvium derived from parent materials of contrasting geologic composition. We present a conceptual model in which solute retention in streams results from hydrologic retention (increased water residence time resulting from surface-groundwater exchange), biological nutrient cycling, and chemical processes. Solute injection experiments were done in study catchments comprised of sandstone-siltstone (site 1), volcanic tuff (site 2), and granite-gneiss (site 3). Distribution of an injected conservative tracer (Br) illustrated that rate and extent of surface-water penetration into the alluvial aquifer increased across study catchments as was predicted from increasing alluvial hydraulic conductivity. Concurrently, groundwater inputs at baseflow represented between 13 and 57{\%} of aboveground discharge at upstream transects, indicating bidirectional hydrologic exchange along the study reaches. N: P ratios in surface water ranged from 4 to 16, suggesting strong biotic demand for inorganic N. Coinjection of NaBr and NaNO 3 revealed longest nitrate uptake length (S(w)) at site 1, intermediate S(w) at site 2, and shortest uptake length at site 3. Modeling of transient hydrologic solute storage revealed that S(w) correlated with hydraulic storage, suggesting an important role for subsurface processes in total nitrate retention.},

abstract = {There is a vivid debate on the relative importance of local and regional factors in shaping microbial communities, and on whether microbial organisms show a biogeographic signature in their distribution. Taking a metacommunity approach, spatial factors can become important either through dispersal limitation (compare large spatial scales) or mass effects (in case of strongly connected systems). We here analyze two datasets on bacterial communities [characterized by community fingerprinting through denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)] in meso- to eutrophic shallow lakes to investigate the importance of spatial factors at three contrasting scales. Variation partitioning on datasets of both the bacterial communities of 11 shallow lakes that are part of a strongly interconnected and densely packed pond system {\textless}1 km apart, three groups of shallow lakes approximately 100 km apart, as well as these three groups of shallow lakes combined that span a large part of a North-South gradient in Europe ({\textgreater}2,500 km) shows a strong impact of local environmental factors on bacterial community composition, with a marginal impact of spatial distance. Our results indicate that dispersal is not strongly limiting even at large spatial scales, and that mass effects do not have a strong impact on bacterial communities even in physically connected systems. We suggest that the fast population growth rates of bacteria facilitate efficient species sorting along environmental gradients in bacterial communities over a very broad range of dispersal rates.},

First, we describe the occurrence of colony formation within different strains of green algae (Scenedesmaceae) in response to infochemicals released during grazing by the herbivorous rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus. Then we examined the effects of inducible defenses on the population dynamics of this planktonic system in which algal strains that differed in their defence strategies were used. Simple food chains were composed of green algae (Scenedesmaceae), herbivorous rotifers (Brachionus calyciflorus) and carnivorous rotifers (Asplanchna brightwellii). In this system B. calyciflorus exhibits an inducible defence against predation by developing long postero-lateral spines. Experimental studies showed that inducible defenses, as opposed to their absence, could prevent high-amplitude population fluctuations. We discuss the dual effects of induced defenses on extinction probabilities and consider the fit of a theoretical model to experimental data to understand the mechanisms that underlie the observed dynamics.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Theoretical studies have shown that inducible defences have the potential to affect population stability and persistence in bi- and tritrophic food chains. Experimental studies on such effects of prey defence strategies on the dynamics of predator-prey systems are still rare. We performed replicated population dynamics experiments using the herbivorous rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and four strains of closely related algae that show different defence responses to this herbivore. 2. We observed herbivore populations to fluctuate at a higher frequency when feeding on small undefended algae. During these fluctuations minimum rotifer densities remained sufficiently high to ensure population persistence in all the replicates. The initial growth of rotifer populations in this treatment coincided with a sharp drop in algal density. Such a suppression of algae by herbivores was not observed in the other treatments, where algae were larger due to induced or permanent defences. In these treatments we observed rotifer population densities to first rise and then decline. The herbivore went extinct in all replicates with large permanently defended algae. The frequency of herbivore extinctions was intermediate when algae had inducible defences. 3. A variety of alternative mechanisms could explain differential herbivore persistence in the different defence treatments. Our analysis showed the density and fraction of highly edible algal particles to better explain herbivore persistence and extinctions than total algal density, the fraction of highly inedible food particles or the accumulation of herbivore waste products or autotoxins. 4. We argue that the rotifers require a minimum fraction and density of edible food particles for maintenance and reproduction. We conjecture that induced defences in algae may thus favour larger zooplankton species such as Daphnia spp. that are less sensitive to shifts in their food size spectrum, relative to smaller zooplankton species, such as rotifers and in this way contributes to the structuring of planktonic communities.},

abstract = {Ecologists have long debated the role of predation in mediating the coexistence of prey species. Theory has mainly taken a bitrophic perspective that excludes the effects of inducible defenses at different trophic levels. However, inducible defenses could either limit or enhance the effects of predation on coexistence, by means of effects on bottom-up control and population stability. Our aim was to investigate how inducible defenses at different trophic levels affect the possibilities for predator-mediated coexistence, as opposed to competitive exclusion, in replicated experimental plankton communities. In particular, we analyzed how the presence or absence of inducible defenses in algal basal prey affected the outcome of competition between an inducible defended and an undefended herbivore, in the presence or absence of a carnivore. We found the undefended herbivore to be a superior competitor in the absence of predation. This outcome was reversed in the presence of a shared carnivore: populations of the undefended herbivore then strongly declined. The extent of this population decline differed between food webs based on undefended as opposed to inducible defended algal prey. In the former the undefended herbivore became undetectable for most of the duration of the experiment. In the latter the undefended herbivore also crashed to low densities, but it could still be detected during most of the experiment. In food webs based on inducible defended algae, the carnivore failed to reach high densities and exerted weaker top-down control on the two competing herbivores. We conclude that the inducible defense in one of our two competing herbivores allowed the outcome of competition to be reversed when a shared carnivore was added. Inducible defenses in algae did not change this outcome, but they significantly delayed extinction of the undefended herbivore. Predation itself did not promote coexistence in these experimental plankton communities.},

Surprisingly few studies have considered the relative contributions of induced plant and herbivore defenses to the overall balance of bottom-up and top-down control. Here we compare trophic cascade strengths using replicated two-level and three-level plankton communities in which we systematically varied the presence or absence of induced defenses at the plant and/or herbivore levels. Our results show that a trophic cascade, i.e., significantly higher plant biomass in three-level than in two-level food chains, occurred whenever herbivores were undefended against carnivores. Trophic cascades did not occur when herbivores exhibited an induced defense. This pattern was obtained irrespective of the presence or absence of induced defenses at the plant level. We thus found that herbivore defenses, not plant defenses, had an overriding effect on cascade strength. We discuss these results in relation to variation in cascade strengths in natural communities.},

abstract = {Many organisms have developed defences to avoid predation by species at higher trophic levels. The capability of primary producers to defend themselves against herbivores affects their own survival, can modulate the strength of trophic cascades and changes rates of competitive exclusion in aquatic communities. Algal species are highly flexible in their morphology, growth form, biochemical composition and production of toxic and deterrent compounds. Several of these variable traits in phytoplankton have been interpreted as defence mechanisms against grazing. Zooplankton feed with differing success on various phytoplankton species, depending primarily on size, shape, cell wall structure and the production of toxins and deterrents. Chemical cues associated with (i) mechanical damage, (ii) herbivore presence and (iii) grazing are the main factors triggering induced defences in both marine and freshwater phytoplankton, but most studies have failed to disentangle the exact mechanism(s) governing defence induction in any particular species. Induced defences in phytoplankton include changes in morphology (e.g. the formation of spines, colonies and thicker cell walls), biochemistry (such as production of toxins, repellents) and in life history characteristics (formation of cysts, reduced recruitment rate). Our categorization of inducible defences in terms of the responsible induction mechanism provides guidance for future work, as hardly any of the available studies on marine or freshwater plankton have performed all the treatments that are required to pinpoint the actual cue(s) for induction. We discuss the ecology of inducible defences in marine and freshwater phytoplankton with a special focus on the mechanisms of induction, the types of defences, their costs and benefits, and their consequences at the community level.},

abstract = {Soil seed banks offer plants the possibility to disperse through time. This has implications for population and community dynamics, as recognised by ecological and evolutionary theory. In contrast, the conservation and restoration literature often find seed banks to be depauperate, weedy and without much conservation value or restoration potential. One explanation for these contrasting views might lie in a systematic bias in the sampling of seed banks versus established plant communities. We use the species– area relationship as a tool to assess and compare the per-area species richness and spatial structuring of the diversity of the established plant community versus soil seed banks. To allow this direct comparison we extensively survey the species–area relationship of the vegetation and underlying seed bank of a grassland community across twelve sites spanning regional bioclimatic gradients. We also compile a global dataset of established plant and seed banks from published sources. We find that seed banks have consistently higher intercepts and slopes of the relationship, and hence higher diversity at any given spatial scale, than the vegetation both in the field and literature study. This is consistent across habitat types, climate gradients, and biomes. Similarity indices are commonly used to compare vegetation and seed bank, and we find that sampling effort ({\%} of the vegetation area sampled for seed bank) was the strongest predictor of vegetation-seed bank similarity for both the S{\o}rensen (R2 = 0.70) and the Raup– Crick (R2 = 0.25) index. Our study suggests that the perception that seed banks are intrinsically less diverse than established plant community has been based more on inadequate sampling than on biological reality. Across a range of ecosystems and climatic settings, we find high diversity in seed banks relative to the established community, suggesting potentially important roles of seed banks in population dynamics and diversity maintenance.},

abstract = {From headwater to mouth, the physical variables within a river system present a continuous gradient of physical conditions. This gradient should elicit a series of responses within the constituent populations resulting in a continuum of biotic adjustments and consistent patterns of loading, transport, utilization, and storage of roganic matter along the length of a river. Based on the energy equilibrium theory of fluvial geomorphologists, we hypothesize that the structural and functional characterristics of stream communities are adapted to conform to the most profitable position or mean state of the physical system. We reason that producer and consumer characteristic of a givevn river reach become established in harmony with the dymanic physical conditions of that channel. In natural stream systems, biological communities can be characterized as forming a temporal continuum of synchronized species replacements. This continuous replacement functions to distribute the utilization of energy inputs over time. Thus, the biological system moves towards a balance between a tendency for efficient use of enery inputs through resource partitioning (foor, substrate, etc) and an opposing tendency for a uniform rate of enery processing throughout the year. We theorize that biological communities developed in natural streams assume processing strategies involving minium energy loss. Downstream communities are fashioned to capitalize on upstream processing inefficiencies. Both upstream inefficiency (leakage) and the downstream adjustments seem predictable. We propose that this Rivier Continuum Concept provides a framework for integrating predictable and observable biological features of lotic systems. Impliations of the concept in the areas of structure, function, and stability of riverine ecosystems are discussed.},

abstract = {Both ecological and evolutionary mechanisms have been proposed to describe how natural communities become assembled at both regional and biogeographical scales. Yet, these theories have largely been developed in isolation. Here, we unite these separate views and develop an integrated eco-evolutionary framework of community assembly. We use a simulation approach to explore the factors determining the interplay between ecological and evolutionary mechanisms systematically across spatial scales. Our results suggest that the same set of ecological and evolutionary processes can determine community assembly at both regional and biogeographical scales. We find that the importance of evolution and community monopolization effects, defined as the eco-evolutionary dynamics that occur when local adaptation of early established immigrants is fast enough to prevent the later immigration of better pre-adapted species, are not restricted to adaptive radiations on remote islands. They occur at dispersal rates of up to ten individuals per generation, typical for many species at the scale of regional metacommunities. Dispersal capacity largely determines whether ecological species sorting or evolutionary monopolization structure metacommunity diversity and distribution patterns. However, other factors related to the spatial scale at which community assembly processes are acting, such as metacommunity size and the proportion of empty patches, also affect the relative importance of ecology versus evolution. We show that evolution often determines community assembly, and this conclusion is robust to a wide range of assumptions about spatial scale, mode of reproduction, and environmental structure. Moreover, we found that community monopolization effects occur even though species fully pre-adapted to each habitat are abundant in the metacommunity, a scenario expected a priori to prevent any meaningful effect of evolution. Our results strongly support the idea that the same eco-evolutionary processes underlie community assembly at regional and biogeographical scales.},

abstract = {Ecologists have traditionally viewed the total species diversity within a set of communities as the product of the average diversity within a community (alpha) and the diversity among the communities (beta). This multiplicative concept of species diversity contrasts with the lesser known idea that alpha- and beta-diversities sum to give the total diversity. This additive partitioning of species diversity is nearly as old as the multiplicative concept, yet ecologists are just now beginning to use additive partitioning to examine patterns of species diversity. In this review we discuss why additive partitioning remained "hidden" until just a few years ago. The rediscovery of additive partitioning has expanded the way in which ecologists define and measure beta-diversity. Beta diversity is no longer relegated to describing change only along all environmental gradient. Through additive partitioning, beta-diversity is explicitly an average amount of diversity just as is a-diversity. We believe that the additive partitioning of diversity into alpha and beta components will continue to become more widely used because it allows for a direct comparison of alpha- and beta-diversities. It also has particular relevance for testing ecological theory concerned with the determinants of species diversity at multiple spatial scales and potential applications ill conservation biology.},

abstract = {Diversity partitioning has become a popular method for analyzing patterns of alpha and beta diversity. A recent evaluation of the method emphasized a distinction between additive and multiplicative partitioning and further advocated the use of multiplicative partitioning based on a presumed independence between alpha and beta. Concurrently, additive partitioning was criticized for producing dependent alpha and beta estimates. Until now, the issue of statistical independence of alpha and beta (in either type of partitioning) has not been thoroughly examined, partly due to confusion about the meaning of statistical independence. Here, we adopted a probability-based definition of statistical independence that is essentially identical to the definition found in any statistics textbook. We used a data simulation approach to show that alpha and beta diversity are not statistically independent in either additive or multiplicative partitioning. However, the extent of the dependence is not so great that it cannot be overcome by using appropriate statistical techniques to control it. Both additive and multiplicative partitioning are statistically valid and logically sound approaches to analyzing diversity patterns.},

abstract = {Community ecology is often perceived as a "mess, "given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species--the subject matter of community ecology--are influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal to drive community dynamics.},

abstract = {We summarize some of the population-dynamic consequences of the mosaic structure of plant populations for the evolution of seed dispersal. A fairly elaborated set of theoretical ideas exist regarding the evolution of dispersal and we have synthesized some of them in an attempt to make them more accessible to field ecologists. We consider the relationship of these general theoretical ideas to our understanding of fruit and seed dispersal. We develop three related models to describe the similarities and differences in how dispersal functions for risk reduction (bet hedging), escaping the negative consequences of crowding, and escaping high concentrations of relatives. We also briefly discuss directed dispersal as a fourth population-dynamic aspect of dispersal. Dispersal can have a risk-reducing function only when there is global (metapopulation) temporal variance in success. Dispersal to escape the negative consequences of crowding requires only spatial and local temporal environmental variation. Dispersal for escaping high concentrations of relatives requires no environmental variation, but does require genetic population structure. Directed dispersal, defined as non-random into particular patch types contingent on the expectation of local success, is always valuable when possible and represents an advantage independent the others which can occur with random dispersal. In an effort to accommodate for the differences between simple mathematical models and the behavior of complex natural fruit and seed dispersal systems we have discussed the following issues: actual patterns of patch structure and dispersal distance; the implications of plant cosexuality, perenniality, and allocation costs of dispersal structures; and the impact of the detailed nature of density dependence, breeding systems, and genetic structure. We briefly compare the population-dynamic functions of dispersal presented here with the widely cited functions of colonization, escape, and directed dispersal. Finally, we suggest how the theoretical models can be used with field data to estimate the fitness consequences of dispersal.},

It has been widely investigated theoretically, and many putative examples have been cited including practical ones such as the dormancy involved in microbe and weed persistence. However, long-term data on demographic variation from the actual evolutionarily relevant environments have been unavailable to test for its mechanistic relationship to alleged bet hedging traits. I report an association between delayed germination (a bet hedging trait) and risk using a 22-year data set on demographic variation for 10 species of desert annual plants. Species with greater variation in reproductive success (per capita survival from germination to reproduction x per capita fecundity of survivors) were found to have lower average germination fractions. This provides a definitive test using realistic data on demographic variance that confirms the life history prediction for bet hedging. I also showed that the species with greater long-term demographic variation tended to be the ones with greater sensitivity of reproductive success to variation among years in growing-season precipitation.},

abstract = {A model is developed to consider the interplay between dispersibility and delayed germination in desert annuals. The model explores the effect of low levels of dispersal, considered realistic for annual plants, on optimal germination fraction. The model also demonstrates the effect of the amount and accuracy of "predictive" (responsive to the environment) dormancy on the optimal innate germination fraction (not responsive to environmental conditions). Optimal germination fraction is found to be very sensitive to changes in despersibility especially at the limited dispersibilities that are realistic for annual plants. As dispersibility increases, optimal germination fraction increases. If plants make two kinds of seeds with differing despersibility, reproduction is maximized if the low dispersal seeds have delayed germination and the high dispersal seeds have quick germination. If dormancy mechanisms permit seeds to germinate when environmental conditions allow successful maturation, and remain dormant when environmental conditions do not permit successful maturation, what fraction of seeds should remain dormant under predicted good conditions as a hedge against inaccurate prediction of the environment? If environmental cues that break dormancy are uncorrelated with enviromnental conditions that permit successful maturation, predictive dormancy has little or no effect on the optimal innate germination fraction. When predictive dormancy lowers the probability of germinating when environmental conditions preclude successful maturation, the optimal innate germination fraction increases with increasing germination control by predictive dormancy. With a moderate degree of germination control by predictive dormancy, the optimal innate dormancy is still sensitive to changes in dispersal in the low dispersal ranges characteristic of annual plants. Evidence is presented from plant species that have both dispersal and germination dimorphisms to support the predicted correlation of high germination fractions with high dispersal.},

Theoretical and experimental studies have attempted to determine the mechanisms that generate this pattern over short timescales, but little attention has been given to the problem of understanding how diversity and productivity are linked over evolutionary timescales. Here, we investigate the role of dispersal in determining both diversity and productivity over evolutionary timescales, using experimental metacommunities of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens assembled by divergent natural selection. We show that both regional diversity and productivity peak at an intermediate dispersal rate. Moreover, we demonstrate that these two patterns are linked: selection at intermediate rates of dispersal leads to high niche differentiation between genotypes, allowing greater coverage of the heterogeneous environment and a higher regional productivity. We argue that processes that operate over both ecological and evolutionary timescales should be jointly considered when attempting to understand the emergence of ecosystem-level properties such as diversity-function relationships.},

abstract = {The impact of biodiversity on the stability of ecological communities has been debated among biologists for more than a century. Recently summarized empirical evidence suggests that biodiversity tends to enhance the temporal stability of community-level properties such as biomass; however, the underlying mechanisms driving this relationship remain poorly understood. Here, we report the results of a microcosm study in which we used simplified systems of freshwater microalgae to explore how the phylogenetic relatedness of species influences the temporal stability of community biomass by altering the nature of their competitive interactions. We show that combinations of two species that are more evolutionarily divergent tend to have lower temporal stability of biomass. In part, this is due to negative 'selection effects' in which bicultures composed of distantly related species are more likely to contain strong competitors that achieve low biomass. In addition, bicultures of distantly related species had on average weaker competitive interactions, which reduced compensatory dynamics and decreased the stability of community biomass. Our results demonstrate that evolutionary history plays a key role in controlling the mechanisms, which give rise to diversity-stability relationships. As such, patterns of shared ancestry may help us predict the ecosystem-level consequences of biodiversity loss.},

abstract = {In this article we use moving averages to develop new classes of models in a flexible modeling framework for stream networks. Streams and rivers are among our most important resources, yet models with autocorrelated errors for spatially continuous stream networks have been described only recently. We develop models based on stream distance rather than on Euclidean distance. Spatial autocovariance models developed for Euclidean distance may not be valid when using stream distance. We begin by describing a stream topology. We then use moving averages to build several classes of valid models for streams. Various models are derived depending on whether the moving average has a “tail-up” stream, a “tail-down” stream, or a “two-tail” construction. These models also can account for the volume and direction of flowing water. The data for this article come from the Ecosystem Health Monitoring Program in Southeast Queensland, Australia, an important national program aimed at monitoring water quality.We model two water chemistry variables, pH and conductivity, for sample sizes close to 100. We estimate fixed effects and make spatial predictions. One interesting aspect of stream networks is the possible dichotomy of autocorrelation between flow-connected and flow-unconnected locations. For this reason, it is important to have a flexible modeling framework, which we achieve on the example data using a variance component approach.},

abstract = {We develop spatial statistical models for stream networks that can estimate relationships between a response variable and other covariates, make predictions at unsampled locations, and predict an average or total for a stream or a stream segment. There have been very few attempts to develop valid spatial covariance models that incorporate flow, stream distance, or both. The application of typical spatial autocovariance functions based on Euclidean distance, such as the spherical covariance model, are not valid when using stream distance. In this paper we develop a large class of valid models that incorporate flow and stream distance by using spatial moving averages. These methods integrate a moving average function, or kernel, against a white noise process. By running the moving average function upstream from a location, we develop models that use flow, and by construction they are valid models based on stream distance. We show that with proper weighting, many of the usual spatial models based on Euclidean distance have a counterpart for stream networks. Using sulfate concentrations from an example data set, the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS), we show that models using flow may be more appropriate than models that only use stream distance. For the MBSS data set, we use restricted maximum likelihood to fit a valid covariance matrix that uses flow and stream distance, and then we use this covariance matrix to estimate fixed effects and make kriging and block kriging predictions.},

abstract = {Intraguild predation (IGP) is a widespread ecological phenomenon in which two consumers that share a resource also engage in a predator-prey interaction. Theory on IGP predicts the occurrence of alternative stable states, but empirical evidence of such states is scarce. This raises the question of whether alternative states are a rare phenomenon that is unlikely to be observed in nature. Here we analyze a model in which the resource exhibits logistic or chemostat dynamics and consumers have saturating (Type II) functional responses. We show that alternative states can arise for a wide range of biological scenarios and that environmental constraints can make their detection difficult. Our analysis identifies three possible combinations of alternative states: (i) IG prey or IG predator, (ii) coexistence or IG predator, and (iii) coexistence or IG prey. Bifurcation diagrams reveal that alternative states are possible over large regions of the parameter space. However, they can be limited to narrow ranges along the resource productivity axis, which may make it difficult to observe the occurrence of alternative states in communities with IGP. Microcosm experiments provide a promising avenue for detecting combinations of asymptotically stable states along a productivity gradient.},

abstract = {To date, little is known about the relative importance of dispersal related versus local factors in shaping microbial metacommunities. A common criticism regarding existing datasets is that the level of taxonomic resolution might be too coarse to reliably assess microbial community structure and study biogeographical patterns. Moreover, few studies have assessed the importance of geographic distance between habitats, which may influence metacommunity dynamics through its effect on dispersal rates. We applied variation partitioning analyses to 15 separate regional datasets on diatoms found in lakes in Eurasia, Africa and Antarctica. These analyses quantified the relative contributions of dispersal related and local factors in determining patterns of taxonomic turnover at the species and at the genus level. In general, results were similar at both taxonomic levels. Local environmental factors accounted for most of the explained variation (median=21{\%}), whereas dispersal related factors were much less important (median of significant fractions=5.5{\%} variation explained) and failed to significantly explain any variation, independent of the environmental variables, in the majority of the datasets. However, the amount of variation explained by dispersal related factors increased with increasing geographic distance and increasing taxonomic resolution. We extrapolated our regional scale observations to the global scale by combining the regional datasets into a global dataset comprising 1039 freshwater lakes from both hemispheres and spanning a geographic distance of over 19 000 km. At this global scale, taxonomic turnover was lowest in highly connected habitats, once environmental factors were partialled out. In common with many other studies of macro-organisms, these analyses showed that both dispersal related and local variables significantly contribute to the structure of global lacustrine diatom communities.},

Here we evaluate this model prediction and show that inducible defences in algae stabilize the dynamics of experimentally assembled bi- and tritrophic planktonic food chains. At high phosphorus levels, we observed strong population fluctuations in all food chains with undefended algae. These fluctuations did not occur when algae had inducible defences. At low phosphorus levels, we observed deterministic consumer extinctions, as predicted by stoichiometric theory. Our study thus shows that both biotically and abiotically induced changes in algal food quality affect the stability and persistence of planktonic food chains.},

Bacterial growth efficiency showed a wide range (2.5-28.7{\%}) and low mean value (12{\%}). These variations were not correlated with the DOC concentration. Our results show that heterotrophic bacterial carbon mineralization in this kind of system during autumn is conditioned by the combined availability of labile carbon and phosphorus, with the assimilated carbon mainly transformed to inorganic carbon in respiration, contributing to CO2 supersaturation in these systems.},

abstract = {The study of interactions between consumers and their resources has led to three important but largely separate bodies of theory: optimal foraging theory, density-dependent habitat selection, and consumer-resource theory. In this article, we draw on all three to study mechanisms of coexistence, uniting these fields of theory via a set of related models based on Holling's disc equation and four different types and arrangements of resources. Using established rules for optimal behavior and habitat selection within a framework of consumer-resource models, we explore how unavoidable trade-offs in conversion efficiency, handling time, and encounter efficiency affect coexistence between species. When resources are nutritionally substitutable and spatially mixed, our model predicts that only trade-offs in encounter efficiency can promote coexistence. For spatially separate substitutable resources, any trade-off in encounter, conversion, or handling efficiency allows coexistence. For essential resources, whether mixed or separate, only trade-offs in conversion efficiency can promote coexistence. Since trade-offs that promote coexistence vary depending on the type of resource, this indicates that mechanisms of coexistence can differ depending on how consumers view their resources and how resources are distributed in the environment.},

Methods for predicting the evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) used by the surviving species are now available for a large class of dynamic population models. Here we expand a previously developed evolutionary game theory, which can be used to predict ESSs in a large class of models, by introducing strategy dynamics. By so doing, a more complete description of the evolutionary process is obtained. One not only obtains a convenient way of determining evolutionarily stable strategies, but interesting features about the evolutionary process itself can be observed. Of particular interest here, we show that the number of strategies which are evolutionarily stable can change as certain environmental factors involved with the model change. The process by which the ESS is formed is examined in terms of an "adaptive landscape" formed by our fitness generating function (G-function). The G-function has properties that enhance the likelihood that the various adaptive peaks will be occupied.},

abstract = {Nutrient limitation to primary productivity and other biological processes is widespread in terrestrial ecosystems, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the most common limiting elements, both individually and in combination. Mechanisms that drive P limitation, and their interactions with the N cycle, have received less attention than mechanisms causing N limitation. We identify and discuss six mechanisms that could drive P limitation in terrestrial ecosystems. The best known of these is depletion-driven limitation, in which accumulated P losses during long-term soil and ecosystem development contribute to what Walker and Syers termed a ‘‘terminal steady state'' of profound P depletion and limitation. The other mechanisms are soil barriers that prevent access to P; transactional limitation, in which weathering of P-containing minerals does not keep pace with the supply of other resources; low-P parent materials; P sinks; and anthropogenic changes that increase the supply of other resources (often N) relative to P. We distinguish proximate nutrient limitation (which occurs where additions of a nutrient stimulate biological processes, especially productivity) from ultimate nutrient limitation (where additions of a nutrient can transform ecosystems). Of the mechanisms that drive P limitation, we suggest that depletion, soil barriers, and low-P parent material often cause ultimate limitation because they control the ecosystem mass balance of P. Similarly, demand-independent losses and constraints to N fixation can control the ecosystem-level mass balance of N and cause it to be an ultimate limiting nutrient.},

abstract = {While ecologists involved in management or policy often are advised to learn to deal with uncertainty, there are a number of components of global environmental change of which we are certain -certain that they are going on, and certain that they are human-caused. Some of these are largely ecological changes, and all have important ecological consequences. Three of the well-documented global changes are: increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; alteration in the biogeochemistry of the global nitrogen cycle; and ongoing land use/land cover change. Human activity -now primarily fossil fuel combustion- has increased carbon dioxide concentrations from {\~{}}280 to 355 µL/L since 1800; the increase is unique, at least in the past 160 000 yr, and severa lines of evidence demonstrate unequivocally that it is human-caused. This increase is likely to have climatic consequences -and certainlt it has direct effects on biota in all Earth's terrestrial ecosystems. The global nitrogen cycle has been altered by human activity to such an extent that more introgen is fixed annually by humanity (primarily for nitrogen fertilizer, also by legume crops and as a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion) than by all natural pathways combined. This added nitrogenalters the chamistry of the atmosphere and of aquatic ecosystems, contributes to eutrophication of the biosphere, and has substantial regional effect on biological diversity in the most affected areas. Finally, human land use/land cover change has transformed one-third to one-half of Earth's ice-free surface. This is and of itself probably represents the most important component of global change now and will for some decades to come; it has profound effects on biological diversity on land and on ecosystems downwind and downstream of affected area. Overall, any clear dichotomy between pristine ecosystems and human-altered areas that may have existed in the past has vanished, and ecological research should account for this reality. These three and other equally certain components of global environmental change are the primary causes of anticipated changes in climate, and of ongoing losses of biological diversity. They are caused in turn by the extraordinary growth in size and resource use of the human population. On a broad scale, there is little uncertainty about any of these components of change or their causes. However, much of the public believes the causes -even the existence- of global change to be uncertain and contentious topics. By speaking out effectively, we can help to shift the focus of public discussion towards what can and should be done about environmental change.},

abstract = {High dispersal rates between patches in spatially structured populations can impede diversification and homogenize diversity. These homogenizing effects of dispersal are likely to be enhanced by coevolving parasites that impose strong selection on hosts for resistance. However, the interactive effects of dispersal and parasites on host diversification have never been tested. We used spatially structured, experimental populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, cultured with or without the phage SBW25Ф2 under three levels of dispersal (none, localized or global), and quantified diversity in terms of evolved bacterial colony morphologies after approximately 100 bacterial generations. We demonstrate that higher levels of colony morphology richness evolved in the presence of phage, and that dispersal reduced diversity most strongly in the presence of phage. Thus, our results suggest that, while parasites can drive host diversification, host populations coevolving with parasites are more prone to homogenization through dispersal.},

abstract = {Top predators are known to play an important role in the assembly of communities via two mechanisms: (1) by altering the colonization (or emigration) patterns of prey through behavioral habitat selection, and (2) by altering vital rates (e.g. mortality, birth) of prey after colonization. While both these mechanisms act to determine assembly, research has focused on either their combined overall effects (confounding them), or examined them singly. As a result, it remains unclear how these mechanisms act to sequentially shape community structure. In this study, we experimentally disentangle habitat selection and post-colonization effects of predaceous fish to test their independent and combined influence on the assembly of insect and larval amphibian communities in experimental freshwater habitats. Specifically, we ask, 'do the behavioral choices of colonists continue to structure aquatic communities even after post-colonization processes have occurred?' Like previous studies, we found that colonization was strongly reduced by the presence of fish cues. More importantly, these effects of fish on prey colonization behavior combined independently with post-colonization processes to determine the overall effect of predators on community assembly. Although habitat selection and predation both reduced abundance and biomass of most taxa in the post-colonization communities, these factors had qualitatively different effects on aspects of trophic structure. Habitat selection altered the ratio of secondary to primary consumer abundance and biomass, while post-colonization predation drove strong trophic cascades not observed in response to habitat selection. Our results suggest that behavioral choices regarding habitat selection can have lasting and unique effects on the structure of aquatic communities.},

Here we present the first worldwide synthesis to jointly consider human and biodiversity perspectives on water security using a spatial framework that quantifies multiple stressors and accounts for downstream impacts. We find that nearly 80{\%} of the world's population is exposed to high levels of threat to water security. Massive investment in water technology enables rich nations to offset high stressor levels without remedying their underlying causes, whereas less wealthy nations remain vulnerable. A similar lack of precautionary investment jeopardizes biodiversity, with habitats associated with 65{\%} of continental discharge classified as moderately to highly threatened. The cumulative threat framework offers a tool for prioritizing policy and management responses to this crisis, and underscores the necessity of limiting threats at their source instead of through costly remediation of symptoms in order to assure global water security for both humans and freshwater biodiversity.},

abstract = {We investigated the relative importance of a behavioural defence (refuge use through diel vertical migration) and a life history change (a reduced size at first reproduction) that are used by daphnids to decrease the risk of predation by visually hunting fish. We used an individual based model of a Daphnia population in a stratified lake to quantify the effects of these inducible defences on Daphnia predation-mortality and the resulting Daphnia population dynamics. Our analysis shows that diel vertical migration (DVM) confers a much stronger protection against fish predation than a reduced size at first reproduction (SFR). DVM allows daphnids to withstand a higher predation pressure in the epilimnion and it decelerates a Daphnia population decline more strongly than a reduced SFR. DVM effectively reduces the (P/B) flow of carbon from daphnids to fish. Many theoretical studies have only considered the fitness benefits of DVM above 'staying up' in the epilimnion of a lake. Our results suggest that 'staying down' in the hypolimnion would confer an even stronger fitness benefit to Daphnia than DVM at times of peak predation risk. Daphnids that remain in the hypolimnion avoid the predation suffered by migrating daphnids around dusk and dawn. Staying down could prevent a Daphnia population decline, while DVM and a reduced SFR can only decelerate the decrease of Daphnia population densities under heavy fish predation. Staying down at high concentrations of fish infochemicals has in fact been observed within a variety of Daphnia clones and species, both in the laboratory and in stratified lakes.},

abstract = {In order to evaluate the effects of inducible defences on community stability and persistence, we analyzed models of bitrophic and tritrophic food chains that incorporate consumer-induced polymorphisms. These models predict that intra-specific heterogeneity in defence levels resolves the paradox of enrichment for a range of top-down effects that affect consumer death rates and for all possible levels of primary productivity. We show analytically that this stability can be understood in terms of differences in handling times on the different prey types. Our predictions still hold when defences also affect consumer attack rates. The predicted stability occurs in both bitrophic and tritrophic food chains. Inducible defences may promote population persistence in tritrophic food chains. Here the minimum densities of cycling populations remain bound away from zero, thus decreasing the risk of population extinctions. However, the reverse can be true for the equivalent bitrophic predator-prey model. This shows that theoretical extrapolations from simple to complex communities should be made with caution. Our results show that inducible defences are among the ecological factors that promote stability in multitrophic communities.},

abstract = {Resource edibility is a crucial factor in ecological theory on the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down control. Current theory explains trophic structure in terms of the relative abundance and succession of edible and inedible species across gradients of primary productivity. We argue that this explanation is incomplete owing to its focus on inedibility and the assumption that plants and herbivores have fixed defense levels. Consumer-induced defenses are an important source of variation in the vulnerability of prey and are prevalent in natural communities. Such induced defenses decrease per capita consumption rates of consumers but hardly ever result in complete inedibility. When defenses are inducible a prey population may consist of both undefended and defended individuals. Here we use food chain models with realistic parameter values to show that variation in consumption rates on different prey types causes a gradual instead of stepwise increase in the biomass of all trophic levels in response to enrichment. Such all-level responses have been observed in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and in microbial food chains in the laboratory. We stress that, in addition to the known food web effects of interspecific variation in edibility, intraspecific variation in edibility is another form of within-trophic-level heterogeneity that also has such effects. We conclude that inducible defenses increase the relative importance of bottom-up control.},

@article{Wagner2005,
abstract = {Species patchiness implies that nearby observations of species abundance tend to be similar or that individual conspecific organisms are more closely spaced than by random chance. This can be caused either by the positive spatial autocorrelation among the locations of individual organisms due to ecological spatial processes (e.g., species dispersal, competition for space and resources) or by spatial dependence due to (positive or negative) species responses to underlying environmental conditions. Both forms of spatial structure pose problems for statistical analysis, as spatial autocorrelation in the residuals violates the assumption of independent observations, while environmental heterogeneity restricts the comparability of replicates. In this paper, we discuss how spatial structure due to ecological spatial processes and spatial dependence affects spatial statistics, landscape metrics, and statistical modeling of the species-environment correlation. For instance, while spatial statistics can quantify spatial pattern due to an endogeneous spatial process, these methods are severely affected by landscape environmental heterogeneity. Therefore, statistical models of species response to the environment not only need to accommodate spatial structure, but need to distinguish between components due to exogeneous and endogeneous processes rather than discarding all spatial variance. To discriminate between different components of spatial structure, we suggest using (multivariate) spatial analysis of residuals or delineating the spatial realms of a stationary spatial process using boundary detection algorithms. We end by identifying conceptual and statistical challenges that need to be addressed for adequate spatial analysis of landscapes. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Exclusion of leaf litter had a strong bottom-up effect that was propagated through detritivores to predators. Most invertebrate taxa in the predominant habitat declined in either abundance, biomass, or both, compared with taxa in a nearby reference stream.

Thus, the ecosystem-level consequences of excluding detrital inputs to an ecosystem were demonstrated.

abstract = {Export of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) was measured from streams draining Catchments 53, 54, and 55 (C53, C54, and C55) at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory for 5 yr, encompassing the driest and wettest years of the past 55-yr record. Macroinvertebrate populations in C54 were reduced for 3 yr by seasonal treatments with insecticide. During pesticide treatment, FPOM concentrations decreased abruptly in C54, remained well below those of reference streams for the 3-yr treatment period, and then increased during the 1st yr of recovery. Macroinvertebrate reduction resulted in an estimated 170-200 kg loss in FPOM export during the 3 yr of treatment and 1st yr of recovery. Annual export of FPOM was strongly related to annual discharge, but the impact of biotic manipulation on FPOM export in C54 was at least as great as that produced by extreme high and low discharges. FPOM export during sampling intervals was directly related to maximum discharge during the intervals. Treatment of C54 significantly reduced FPOM export per unit maximum discharge. Seasonal relationships between FPOM export and maximum discharge indicated more export per unit maximum discharge in summer in reference streams and C54 in untreated years. In contrast, during treatment years of C54, export per unit maximum discharge was lowest in summer. FPOM concentrations measured during storms showed increasing concentrations with increasing discharge in all streams, however, much mor FPOM was suspended in the reference streams than in C54. Thus, macroinvertebrate reduction altered the magnitude of FPOM export during storms, the seasonal pattern of export, and the annual export of FPOM.},

abstract = {Dormancy is an essential strategy for microorganisms to cope with environmental stress. However, global ecosystem models typically ignore microbial dormancy, resulting in notable model uncertainties. To facilitate the consideration of dormancy in these large-scale models, we propose a new microbial physiology component that works for a wide range of substrate availabilities. This new model is based on microbial physiological states and the major parameters are the maximum specific growth and maintenance rates of active microbes and the ratio of dormant to active maintenance rates. A major improvement of our model over extant models is that it can explain the low active microbial fractions commonly observed in undisturbed soils. Our new model shows that the exponentially-increasing respiration from substrate-induced respiration experiments can only be used to determine the maximum specific growth rate and initial active microbial biomass, while the respiration data representing both exponentially-increasing and non-exponentially-increasing phases can robustly determine a range of key parameters including the initial total live biomass, initial active fraction, the maximum specific growth and maintenance rates, and the half-saturation constant. Our new model can be incorporated into existing ecosystem models to account for dormancy in microbially-driven processes and to provide improved estimates of microbial activities.},

abstract = {Opportunistic pathogens occurring in premise (i.e., building) plumbing systems, including strains of Legionella, Mycobacterium, Acanthamoeba, and Pseudomonas, are now frequently cited agents of waterborne disease outbreaks. Unlike traditional fecal pathogens, opportunistic pathogens are part of the drinking water microbial ecology and therefore require new paradigms for their control. With the onset of the "microbiome era", notions of eradicating all microbes in drinking water have proven unrealistic, making a probiotic concept worthy of consideration. Research is needed to better understand how engineering controls may individually, or in combination, select for a desirable microbiome, and how the microbiome itself may mediate proliferation of opportunistic pathogens. Ecological interactions such as competition, antagonism, and obligate parasite-host relationships offer potential targets for probiotic control of opportunistic pathogens. A probiotic approach may be defined as intentional inoculation of beneficial microbes or choosing conditions that select for a desirable microbiome. This critical review synthesizes the state of the knowledge of the factors governing opportunistic pathogen control in premise plumbing and potential opportunities for and barriers to implementation of a probiotic approach. Future effort is recommended to demonstrate the feasibility of the probiotic concept; to develop effective, practical, and safe protocols; and to engage relevant stakeholders in evaluating options and assessing corresponding risks.},

abstract = {Availability of safe, pathogen-free drinking water is vital to public health; however, it is impossible to deliver sterile drinking water to consumers. Recent microbiome research is bringing new understanding to the true extent and diversity of microbes that inhabit water distribution systems. The purpose of this study was to determine how water chemistry in main distribution lines shape the microbiome in drinking water biofilms and to explore potential associations between opportunistic pathogens and indigenous drinking water microbes. Effects of disinfectant (chloramines, chlorine), water age (2.3 days, 5.7 days), and pipe material (cement, iron, PVC) were compared in parallel triplicate simulated water distribution systems. Pyrosequencing was employed to characterize bacteria and terminal restriction fragment polymorphism was used to profile both bacteria and eukaryotes inhabiting pipe biofilms. Disinfectant and water age were both observed to be strong factors in shaping bacterial and eukaryotic community structures. Pipe material only influenced the bacterial community structure (ANOSIM test, P {\textless} 0.05). Interactive effects of disinfectant, pipe material, and water age on both bacteria and eukaryotes were noted. Disinfectant concentration had the strongest effect on bacteria, while dissolved oxygen appeared to be a major driver for eukaryotes (BEST test). Several correlations of similarity metrics among populations of bacteria, eukaryotes, and opportunistic pathogens, as well as one significant association between mycobacterial and proteobacterial operational taxonomic units, provides insight into means by which manipulating the microbiome may lead to new avenues for limiting the growth of opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Legionella) or other nuisance organisms (e.g., nitrifiers).},

abstract = {Although elevational gradients in microbial biodiversity have attracted increasing attention recently, the generality in the patterns and underlying mechanisms are still poorly resolved. Further, previous studies focused mostly on species richness, while left understudied evenness, another important aspect of biodiversity. Here, we studied the elevational patterns in species richness and evenness of stream biofilm bacteria and diatoms in six mountains in Asia and Europe. We also reviewed published results for elevational richness patterns for soil and stream microbes in a literature analysis. Our results revealed that even within the same ecosystem type (that is, stream) or geographical region, bacteria and diatoms showed contrasting patterns in diversity. Stream microbes, including present stream data, tend to show significantly increasing or decreasing elevational patterns in richness, contrasting the findings for soil microbes that typically showed nonsignificant or significantly decreasing patterns. In all six mountains for bacteria and in four mountains for diatoms, species richness and evenness were positively correlated. The variation in bacteria and diatom richness and evenness were substantially explained by anthropogenic driven factors, such as total phosphorus (TP). However, diatom richness and evenness were also related to different main drivers as richness was mostly related to pH, while evenness was most explained by TP. Our results highlight the lack of consistent elevational biodiversity patterns of microbes and further indicate that the two facets of biodiversity may respond differently to environmental gradients.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence has emerged for non-random spatial distributions of microbes, but knowledge of the processes that cause variation in microbial assemblage among ecosystems is lacking. For instance, some studies showed that deterministic processes such as habitat specialization are important, while other studies hold that bacterial communities are assembled by stochastic forces. Here we examine the relative influence of deterministic and stochastic processes for bacterial communities from subsurface environments, stream biofilm, lake water, lake sediment and soil using pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. We show that there is a general pattern in phylogenetic signal in species ecological niches across recent evolutionary time for all studied habitats, enabling us to infer the influences of community assembly processes from patterns of phylogenetic turnover in community composition. The phylogenetic dissimilarities among-habitat types were significantly higher than within them, and the communities were clustered according to their original habitat types. For communities within-habitat types, the highest phylogenetic turnover rate through space was observed in subsurface environments, followed by stream biofilm on mountainsides, whereas the sediment assemblages across regional scales showed the lowest turnover rate. Quantifying phylogenetic turnover as the deviation from a null expectation suggested that measured environmental variables imposed strong selection on bacterial communities for nearly all sample groups. For three sample groups, spatial distance reflected unmeasured environmental variables that impose selection, as opposed to spatial isolation. Such characterization of spatial and environmental variables proved essential for proper interpretation of partial Mantel results based on observed beta diversity metrics. In summary, our results clearly indicate a dominant role of deterministic processes on bacterial assemblages and highlight that bacteria show strong habitat associations that have likely emerged through evolutionary adaptation.},

Using high-throughput pyrosequencing, we examined the biodiversity patterns for biofilm bacterial communities that were scraped from stream stones along an elevational gradient from 1820 to 4050 m in China. The patterns of bacterial species richness and phylogenetic diversity were hollow towards higher elevations. The bacterial communities consisted of closer relatives than expected and displayed increasing terminal phylogenetic clustering towards mountain top. The increasing phylogenetic clustering with elevation contrasts reports for macroorganisms that revealed phylogenetic overdispersion at low or intermediate elevations. Because water temperature showed the strongest correlation with phylogenetic relatedness (r(2)  = 0.516), the elevational pattern in the bacterial phylogenetic structure indicated that environmental filtering possibly due to lower temperature or more frequent temperature fluctuations increased towards higher elevations. Evidence supporting the environmental filtering on bacteria was also reflected by the orderly succession in the relative abundance of different bacterial phyla along the elevational gradient and in the high evenness of bacterial taxa at higher elevations. Overall, our results indicated that ecological processes possibly related to temperature may play a dominant role in structuring bacterial biodiversity along the elevational gradient.},

Also, it is not known whether the patterns in turnover among organism groups are affected by the degree to which the environment is modified by human activities. Location Laojun Mountain, Yunnan Province, China. Methods The beta diversity patterns of benthicmicroorganisms (i.e. diatoms and bacteria) and macroorganisms (i.e. macroinvertebrates) in a stony stream were simultaneously investigated between elevations of 1820 and 4050m. Data were analysed by using a distance-based approach and variation partitioning based on canonical redundancy analysis. Results Analyses of community dissimilarities between adjacent sampling sites showed comparable small-scale beta diversity along the elevational gradient for the organismgroups.However, bacteria clearly showed the lowest elevational turnover when analyses were conducted simultaneously for all pairwise sites.Variation par- titioning indicated that species turnover was mostly related to environmental het- erogeneity and spatial gradients including horizontal distance and elevation, while purely human impacts were shown to be less important. Main conclusions The elevational beta diversity at large scales was lower for bacteria than for eukaryotic microorganisms or macroorganisms, perhaps indica- tive of high dispersal ability and good adaptability of bacteria to harsh environ- mental conditions.However, the small-scale beta diversity did not differ among the groups. Elevation was the major driver for the turnover of eukaryotic organisms, while the turnover of bacteria was correlated more with environmental variation. Keywords},

abstract = {Aim Data and analyses of elevational gradients in diversity have been central to the development and evaluation of a range of general theories of biodiversity. Elevational diversity patterns have, however, been severely understudied for microbes, which often represent decomposer subsystems. Consequently, generalities in the patterns of elevational diversity across different trophic levels remain poorly understood. Our aim was to examine elevational gradients in the diversity of macroinvertebrates, diatoms and bacteria along a stony stream that covered a large elevational gradient.  Location Laojun Mountain, Yunnan province, China.  Methods The sampling scheme included 26 sites spaced at elevational intervals of 89 m from 1820 to 4050 m elevation along a stony stream. Macroinvertebrate and diatom richness were determined based on the morphology of the specimens. Taxonomic richness for bacteria was quantified using a molecular fingerprinting method. Over 50 environmental variables were measured at each site to quantify environmental variables that could correlate with the patterns of diversity. We used eigenvector-based spatial filters with multiple regressions to account for spatial autocorrelation.  Results The bacterial richness followed an unexpected monotonic increase with elevation. Diatoms decreased monotonically, and macroinvertebrate richness showed a clear unimodal pattern with elevation. The unimodal richness pattern for macroinvertebrates was best explained by the mid-domain effect (r2 = 0.72). The diatom richness was best explained by the variation in nutrient supply, and the increase in bacterial richness with elevation may be related to an increased carbon supply.  Main conclusions We found contrasting patterns in elevational diversity among the three studied multi-trophic groups comprising unicellular and multicellular aquatic taxa. We also found that there may be fundamental differences in the mechanisms underlying these species diversity patterns.},

abstract = {The domestication of all major crop plants occurred during a brief period in human history about 10,000 years ago. During this time, ancient agriculturalists selected seed of preferred forms and culled out seed of undesirable types to produce each subsequent generation. Consequently, favoured alleles at genes controlling traits of interest increased in frequency, ultimately reaching fixation. When selection is strong, domestication has the potential to drastically reduce genetic diversity in a crop. To understand the impact of selection during maize domestication, we examined nucleotide polymorphism in teosinte branched1, a gene involved in maize evolution. Here we show that the effects of selection were limited to the gene's regulatory region and cannot be detected in the protein-coding region. Although selection was apparently strong, high rates of recombination and a prolonged domestication period probably limited its effects. Our results help to explain why maize is such a variable crop. They also suggest that maize domestication required hundreds of years, and confirm previous evidence that maize was domesticated from Balsas teosinte of southwestern Mexico.},

abstract = {The past two decades have seen great progress in understanding the mechanisms of ecosystem stability in local ecological systems. There is, however, an urgent need to extend existing knowledge to larger spatial scales to match the scale of management and conservation. Here, we develop a general theoretical framework to study the stability and variability of ecosystems at multiple scales. Analogously to the partitioning of biodiversity, we propose the concepts of alpha, beta and gamma variability. Gamma variability at regional (metacommunity) scale can be partitioned into local alpha variability and spatial beta variability, either multiplicatively or additively. On average, variability decreases from local to regional scales, which creates a negative variability–area relationship. Our partitioning framework suggests that mechanisms of regional ecosystem stability can be understood by investigating the influence of ecological factors on alpha and beta variability. Diversity can provide insurance effects at the various levels of variability, thus generating alpha, beta and gamma diversity–stability relationships. As a consequence, the loss of biodiversity and habitat impairs ecosystem stability at the regional scale. Overall, our framework enables a synthetic understanding of ecosystem stability at multiple scales and has practical implications for landscape management.},

abstract = {As more human genomic data become available, fine-scale recombination rate variation can be inferred on a genome-wide scale. Current statistical methods to infer recombination rates that can be applied to moderate, or large, genomic regions are limited to approximated likelihoods. Here, we develop a Bayesian full-likelihood method using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate background recombination rates and hotspots. The probability model is inspired by the observed patterns of recombination at several genomic regions analyzed in sperm-typing studies. Posterior probabilities and Bayes factors of recombination hotspots along chromosomes are inferred. For moderate-size genomic regions (e.g., with {\textless}100 SNPs), the full-likelihood method is used. Larger regions are split into subintervals (typically each having between 20 and 50 markers). The likelihood is approximated based on the genealogies for each subinterval. The background recombination rates, hotspots, and parameters are evaluated by using a parallel computing approach and assuming shared parameters across the subintervals. Simulation analyses show that our method can accurately estimate the variation in recombination rates across genomic regions. In particular, clusters of hotspots can be distinguished even though weaker hotspots are present. The method is applied to SNP data from the HLA region, the MS32, and chromosome 19.},

abstract = {Traditional characterization of hyporheic processes relies upon modelling observed in-stream and subsurface breakthrough curves to estimate hyporheic zone size and infer exchange rates. Solute data integrate upstream behaviour and lack spatial coverage, limiting our ability to accurately quantify spatially heterogeneous exchange dynamics. Here, we demonstrate the application of near-surface electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) methods, coupled with experiments using an electrically conductive stream tracer (dissolved NaCl), to provide in situ imaging of spatial and temporal dynamics of hyporheic exchange. Tracer-labelled water in the stream enters the hyporheic zone, reducing electrical resistivity in the subsurface (to which subsurface ERI is sensitive). Comparison of background measurements with those recording tracer presence provides distributed characterization of hyporheic area (in this application, similar to 0.5 m(2)). Results demonstrate the first application of ERI for two-dimensional imaging of stream-aquifer exchange and hyporheic extent. Future application of this technique will greatly enhance our ability to quantify processes controlling solute transport and fate in hyporheic zones, and provide data necessary to inform more complete numerical models.

abstract = {Microbiologists have been constrained in their efforts to describe the compositions of natural microbial communities using traditional methods. Few microorganisms have sufficiently distinctive morphology to be recognized by microscopy. Culture-dependent methods are biased, as a microorganism can be cultivated only after its physiological niche is perceived and duplicated experimentally. It is therefore widely believed that fewer than 20{\%} of the extant microorganisms have been discovered, and that culture methods are inadequate for studying microbial community composition. In view of the physiological and phylogenetic diversity among microorganisms, speculation that 80{\%} or more of microbes remain undiscovered raises the question of how well we know the Earth's biota and its biochemical potential. We have performed a culture-independent analysis of the composition of a well-studied hot spring microbial community, using a common but distinctive cellular component, 16S ribosomal RNA. Our results confirm speculations about the diversity of uncultured microorganisms it contains.},

The work described in this paper is an attempt to attain a broad theoretical perspective of regulated lotic systems over the entire longitudinal stream profile. Discontinuity distance (DD), defined as the longitudinal shift of a given parameter by stream regulation, may be positive (downstream shift), negative (upstream shift), or near zero. The direction and intensity of DD vary as functions of the specific parameter examined and the position of the dam(s) along the longitudinal stream profile. The serial discontinuity concept can be applied to physical parameters (e.g., temperature summation) and biological phenomena at the population (e.g., species abundance patterns), community (e.g., biotic diversity), or ecosystem levels (e.g., photosynthesis/respiration).},

abstract = {The term riverine landscape implies a holistic geomorphic perspective of the extensive interconnected series of biotopes and environmental gradients that, with their biotic communities, constitute fluvial systems. Natural disturbance regimes maintain multiple interactive pathways (connectivity) across the riverine landscape. Disturbance and environmental gradients, acting in concert, result in a positive feedback between connectivity and spatio-temporal heterogeneity that leads to the broad-scale patterns and processes responsible for high levels of biodiversity. Anthropogenic impacts such as flow regulation, channelization, and bank stabilization, by (1) disrupting natural disturbance regimes, (2) truncating environmental gradients, and (3) severing interactive pathways, eliminate upstream-downstream linkages and isolate river channels from riparian/floodplain systems and contiguous groundwater aquifers. These alterations interfere with successional trajectories, habitat diversification, migratory pathways and other processes, thereby reducing biodiversity. Ecosystem management is necessary to maintain or restore biodiversity at a landscape scale. To be effective, conservation efforts should be based on a solid conceptual foundation and a holistic understanding of natural river ecosystems. Such background knowledge is necessary to re-establish environmental gradients, to reconnect interactive pathways, and to reconstitute some semblance of the natural dynamics responsible for high levels of biodiversity. The challenge for the future lies in protecting the ecological integrity and biodiversity of aquatic systems in the face of increasing pressures on our freshwater resources. This will require integrating sound scientific principles with management perspectives that recognize floodplains and groundwaters as integral components of rivers and that are based on sustaining, rather than suppressing, environmental heterogeneity.},

abstract = {Abstract  Investigations of European floodplain rivers demonstrate how landscape ecology can provide an effective framework to integrate pattern and process in river corridors, to examine environmental dynamics and interactive pathways between landscape elements, and to develop viable strategies for river conservation. The highly complex and dynamic nature of intact river corridors is particularly amenable to a landscape ecology perspective. Analysis of spatial patterns has provided considerable insight into environmental heterogeneity across river corridors and is an essential prelude to examining dynamic interactions. For example, data from aerial photographs, digitized maps and year-round field measurements in a glacial flood plain, enabled us to distinguish six channel types, based on the correspondence between connectivity and physicochemical attributes. Spatial data were also used to analyze longitudinal changes in landscape elements along the course of a morphologically-intact riverine corridor, providing insight into the structural complexity that must have characterized many Alpine rivers in the pristine state. Landscape indices were employed to investigate seasonal dynamics in a glacial flood plain of the Swiss Alps which exhibits a predictable expansion/contraction cycle, with corresponding shifts in flow paths (surface and subsurface) and water sources (snowmelt, englacial, subglacial, alluvial aquifer, hillslope aquifer). Surface connectivity exhibited an unexpected biphasic relationship with total channel length, whereas riverscape diversity progressively increased along the entire range of channel length. Reconstituting the functional integrity that characterizes intact river corridors should perhaps be the major goal of river conservation initiatives. Although understanding functional processes at the landscape scale is essential in this regard, few data are available. In the Alluvial Zone National Park on the Austrian Danube, three phases of hydrological connectivity were identified (disconnection, seepage connection and surface connection) that corresponded to the predominance of three functional processes (biotic interactions, primary production and particulate transport) within the river corridor.},

abstract = {1. This review is presented as a broad synthesis of riverine landscape diversity, beginning with an account of the variety of landscape elements contained within river corridors. Landscape dynamics within river corridors are then examined in the context of landscape evolution, ecological succession and turnover rates of landscape elements. This is followed by an overview of the role of connectivity and ends with a riverine landscape perspective of biodiversity. 2. River corridors in the natural state are characterised by a diverse array of landscape elements, including surface waters (a gradient of lotic and lentic waterbodies), the fluvial stygoscape (alluvial aquifers), riparian systems (alluvial forests, marshes, meadows) and geomorphic features (bars and islands, ridges and swales, levees and terraces, fans and deltas, fringing floodplains, wood debris deposits and channel networks). 3. Fluvial action (erosion, transport, deposition) is the predominant agent of landscape evolution and also constitutes the natural disturbance regime primarily responsible for sustaining a high level of landscape diversity in river corridors. Although individual landscape features may exhibit high turnover, largely as a function of the interactions between fluvial dynamics and successional phenomena, their relative abundance in the river corridor tends to remain constant over ecological time. 4. Hydrological connectivity, the exchange of matter, energy and biota via the aqueous medium, plays a major though poorly understood role in sustaining riverine landscape diversity. Rigorous investigations of connectivity in diverse river systems should provide considerable insight into landscape-level functional processes. 5. The species pool in riverine landscapes is derived from terrestrial and aquatic communities inhabiting diverse lotic, lentic, riparian and groundwater habitats arrayed across spatio-temporal gradients. Natural disturbance regimes are responsible for both expanding the resource gradient in riverine landscapes as well as for constraining competitive exclusion. 6. Riverine landscapes provide an ideal setting for investigating how complex interactions between disturbance and productivity structure species diversity patterns.},

A hierarchical approach to diversity in natural and altered river-floodplain ecosystems will enhance understanding of ecological phenomena operating at different scales along multidimensional environmental gradients. 5. Re-establishing functional diversity (e.g. hydrologic and successional processes) across the active corridor could serve as the focus of river conservation initiatives. Once functional processes have been reconstituted, habitat heterogeneity will increase, followed by corresponding increases in species diversity of aquatic and riparian biota.},

The 50th anniversary of MacArthur and Wilson's (December 1963) article, 'An equilibrium theory of insular zoogeography', was a recent milestone for this theme. Since 1963, island systems have provided new insights into the formation of ecological communities. Here, building on such developments, we highlight prospects for research on islands to improve our understanding of the ecology and evolution of communities in general. Throughout, we emphasise how attributes of islands combine to provide unusual research opportunities, the implications of which stretch far beyond islands. Molecular tools and increasing data acquisition now permit re-assessment of some fundamental issues that interested MacArthur and Wilson. These include the formation of ecological networks, species abundance distributions, and the contribution of evolution to community assembly. We also extend our prospects to other fields of ecology and evolution - understanding ecosystem functioning, speciation and diversification - frequently employing assets of oceanic islands in inferring the geographic area within which evolution has occurred, and potential barriers to gene flow. Although island-based theory is continually being enriched, incorporating non-equilibrium dynamics is identified as a major challenge for the future.},

abstract = {This study examines the interactions among geomorphic and biogeographic processes that govern the invasion by two contrasting exotic plant species-a shrub, scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) and an herb, foxglove (Digitalis purpurea), over several decades of road and stream networks in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in western Oregon. Distributions of C. scoparius and D. purpurea were mapped along hillslopes and streams in 1993, 2002, and 2003. The mapped distributions were related to debris flow pathways and changes in stream morphology interpreted from field surveys and air photos over the period 1993 to 2003. Laboratory trials examined the response of seed germination to scarification (to test effects of transport by debris flows), soaking (to test effects of fluvial transport), and substrate texture (to test effects on establishment). C. scoparius and D. purpurea were present along roads and in clearcuts in the Andrews Forest from the 1970s to 2003, but invaded the stream (Lookout Creek) only after debris flows and floods during an extreme storm in 1996. Laboratory trials demonstrated that seeds could germinate on a variety of substrates after scarification and flood transport. Mapping and air photo/GIS analysis indicated that the distributions of exotic plants were located on freshly scoured bars and floodplains adjacent to the active channel, downstream of seed sources along roads that were connected to the main stem of Lookout Creek by road ditch drainage systems, and debris flow paths. This paper outlines a conceptual model for the invasion of exotic plants, highlighting the connectivity between road and stream networks provided by geomorphic processes in steep forested landscapes. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {1. One of two things can happen to allochthonous material once it enters a stream: it can be broken down or it can be transported downstream. The efficiency with which allochthonous material is used is the result of these two opposing factors: breakdown and transport. 2. The present synthesis of new and published studies at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory compares biological use versus transport for four categories of particulate organic material: (1) large wood (logs); (2) small wood (sticks); (3) leaves; and (4) fine particulate organic matter (FPOM). 3. Over 8 years, logs showed no breakdown or movement. 4. The breakdown rate of sticks (less than or equal to 3 cm diameter) ranged from 0.00017 to 0.00103 day(-1), while their rate of transport, although varying considerably with discharge, ranged from 0 to 0.1 m day(-1). 5. Based on 40 published measurements, the average rate of leaf breakdown was 0.0098 day(-1). The leaf transport rate depended on stream size and discharge. 6. The average respiration rate of FPOM was 1.4 mg O-2 g AFDM(-1) day(-1) over a temperature range of 6-22 degrees C, which implies a decomposition rate of 0.00104 day(-1) Transport distances of both corn pollen and glass beads, surrogates of natural FPOM, were short ({\textless} 10 m) except during high discharge. 7. Estimates of transport rate were substantially larger than the breakdown rates for sticks, leaves and FPOM. Thus, an organic particle on the stream bottom is more likely to be transported than broken down by biological processes, although estimates of turnover length suggest that sticks and leaves do not travel far. However, once these larger particles are converted to refractory FPOM, either by physical or biological processes, they may be transported long distances before being metabolized.},

abstract = {Ecological approaches to community assembly have emphasized the interplay between neutral processes, niche-based environmental filtering and niche-based species sorting in an interactive milieu. Recently, progress has been made in terms of aligning our vocabulary with conceptual advances, assessing how trait-based community functional parameters differ from neutral expectation and assessing how traits vary along environmental gradients. Experiments have confirmed the influence of these processes on assembly and have addressed the role of dispersal in shaping local assemblages. Community phylogenetics has forged common ground between ecologists and biogeographers, but it is not a proxy for trait-based approaches. Community assembly theory is in need of a comparative synthesis that addresses how the relative importance of niche and neutral processes varies among taxa, along environmental gradients, and across scales. Towards that goal, we suggest a set of traits that probably confer increasing community neutrality and regionality and review the influences of stress, disturbance and scale on the importance of niche assembly. We advocate increasing the complexity of experiments in order to assess the relative importance of multiple processes. As an example, we provide evidence that dispersal, niche processes and trait interdependencies have about equal influence on trait-based assembly in an experimental grassland.},

abstract = {We propose a computational and theoretical framework for analyzing rapid coevolutionary dynamics of bacteriophage and bacteria in their ecological context. Bacteriophage enter host cells via membrane-bound surface receptors often responsible for nutrient uptake. As such, a selective pressure will exist for the bacteria to modify its receptor configuration and, in turn, for the phage to modify its tail fiber. A mathematical model of these trait adaptations is developed by using the framework of adaptive dynamics. Host strains differ in their efficiency of resource uptake and resistance to phage, whereas phage strains differ in their host preference for adsorption. We solve the evolutionary ecology model and find the conditions for coevolutionary branching and relevant dimensionless parameters leading to distinct quasispecies. We confirm these calculations using stochastic Monte Carlo simulations of populations evolving in a chemostat with fixed washout rate and inflow resource density. We find that multiple quasispecies of bacteria and phage can coexist in a homogeneous medium with a single resource. When diversification occurs, quasispecies of phage adsorb effectively to only a limited subset of the total number of quasispecies of bacteria, i.e., functional differences between quasispecies arise endogenously within the evolutionary ecology framework. Finally, we discuss means to relate predictions of this model to experimental studies in the chemostat, using the model organisms Escherichia coli and the virulent strain of lambda phage.},

Our aim is to link the energetic needs of organisms with the dynamics of interacting populations, for which survival is a result of a game-theoretic struggle for existence. We solve the scaled model of predator-prey dynamics and predict population level characteristics such as the scaling of coexistence size ranges and the optimal predator-prey size ratio. For a broad class of such models, the optimal predator-prey size ratio given available prey of a fixed size is constant. We also demonstrate how scaling predictions of prey density differ under resource limitation vs. predator drawdown. Finally, we show how evolution of predator size can destabilize population dynamics, compare scaling of predator-prey cycles to previous work, as well as discuss possible extensions of the model to multispecies communities.},

By adopting a massively parallel tag sequencing strategy, we show that bacterial communities of deep water masses of the North Atlantic and diffuse flow hydrothermal vents are one to two orders of magnitude more complex than previously reported for any microbial environment. A relatively small number of different populations dominate all samples, but thousands of low-abundance populations account for most of the observed phylogenetic diversity. This "rare biosphere" is very ancient and may represent a nearly inexhaustible source of genomic innovation. Members of the rare biosphere are highly divergent from each other and, at different times in earth's history, may have had a profound impact on shaping planetary processes.},

abstract = {Urban streams have been the focus of much research in recent years, but many questions about the mechanisms driving the urban stream syndrome remain unanswered. Identification of key research questions is an important step toward effective, efficient management of urban streams to meet societal goals. We developed a list of priority research questions by: 1) soliciting input from interested scientists via a listserv and online survey, 2) holding an open discussion on the questions at the Second Symposium on Urbanization and Stream Ecology, and 3) reviewing the literature in the preparation of this paper. We present the resulting list of 26 questions in the context of a review and summary of the present understanding of urban effects on streams. The key questions address major gaps in our understanding of ecosystem structure and function responses (e.g., what are the sublethal impacts of urbanization on biota?), characteristics of urban stream stressors (e.g., can we identify clusters of covarying stressors?), and management strategies (e.g., what are appropriate indicators of ecosystem structure and function to use as management targets?). The identified research needs highlight our limited understanding of mechanisms driving the urban stream syndrome and the variability in characteristics of the effects of urbanization across different biogeoclimatic conditions, stages of development, government policies, and cultural norms. We discuss how to proceed with appropriate management activities given our current incomplete understanding of the urban stream syndrome.},

However, a rapidly expanding body of research has completely overturned this idea, showing that microbes indulge in a variety of social behaviors involving complex systems of cooperation, communication, and synchronization. Work in this area has already provided some elegant experimental tests of social evolutionary theory, demonstrating the importance of factors such as relatedness, kin discrimination, competition between relatives, and enforcement of cooperation.

abstract = {The term "hyporheic zone" is gaining wide usage among those interested in processes and patterns within the stream bed and floodplain sediments. Because of differences in terminol- ogies, methodologies, and dogma among biologists, hydrologists, geomorphologists, and chemists, there is no single, conceptual definition of the hyporheic zone. The hyporheic zone has been defined by distributions of epigean organisms, hypogean organisms, epigean-hypogean associations, nu- trients, organic matter, temperature, underflow paths, etc. Conceptual cross-sectional and longitu- dinal models have been presented for a number of individual research sites. Hydrologically, the hyporheic zone is established by channel water advection and may be defined as a "middle zone" between channel waters above and groundwaters (if present) below. In expanding this definition to include other disciplines, researchers should explicitly state their own working definitions when reporting research. There is a need to begin incorporating hyporheic processes into present lotic paradigms and to develop more interdisciplinary conceptual frameworks that will facilitate hy- pothesis testing and cross-system and intra-system comparisons. Development and refinement of hyporheic research must evolve from greater dialogue among researchers in all the disciplines involved. Key},

abstract = {The importance of genetic interactions in the evolutionary process has been debated for more than half a century. Genetic interactions such as under dominance and epistasis (the interaction among genetic loci in their effects on phenotypes or fitness) can play a special role in the evolutionary process because they can create multiple fitness optima (adaptive peaks) separated by fitness minima (adaptive valleys). The valleys prevent deterministic evolution from one peak to another. We review the evidence that genetic interaction is a common phenomenon in natural populations. Some studies give strong circumstantial evidence for multiple fitness peaks, although the mapping of epistatic interactions onto fitness surfaces remains incompletely explored, and absolute proof that multiple peaks exist can be shown to be empirically impossible. We show that there are many reasons that epistatic polymorphism is very difficult to find, even when interactions are an extremely important part of the genetic system. When polymorphism results in the presence of multiple fitness peaks within a group of interbreeding populations, one fitness peak will quickly be nearly fixed within all interbreeding populations, but when epistatic or under dominant loci are nearly fixed, there will be no direct evidence of genetic interaction. Thus when complex landscapes are evolutionarily most important, evidence for alternative high fitness genetic combinations will be most ephemeral. Genetic interactions have been most clearly demonstrated in wide crosses within species and among closely related species. This evidence suggests that genetic interactions may play an important role in taxonomic diversification and species-level constraints. Population genetic analyses linked with new approaches in metabolic and molecular genetic research are likely to provide exciting new insights into the role of gene interactions in the evolutionary process.},

abstract = {Interrelations among three groups of ideas are considered. (1) The place where a plant is rooted, or a sessile animal is attached, may be termed a microsite. The microsites for a community form a mosaic that is differentiated by physical environment or biological effects or both. Population function and regulation, and community self-maintenance and response to environmental fluctuation, can be approached in terms of the flow of reproducing populations through the mosaic. (2) Most communities are subject to disturbance followed by succession. Communities are diverse in the kinds and frequencies of disturbances and in kinds of successions and climaxes; and the species of a biota diversify in their relationships to successional time and patterns of successional and climax communities. (3) Although mosaic phenomena are general, two broad groupings may be recognized: intracommunity patterns that relate to microsite differentiation and species response to this, and intercommunity successional mosaics and climax complexes for which community disturbance is a major determining force. Relationships between elements of a mosaic can often be formulated in terms of a chain or network of replacement rates, but formulations should allow for the influence of bath terms and occurrence of semipermanent plateau stages in some successions.},

abstract = {Human-induced environmental changes differ from most natural changes in which they happen at a faster rate and require quicker responses from populations. The first response of populations is usually phenotypically plastic alterations of morphology, physiology and behaviour. This plasticity can be favourable and move the population closer to an adaptive peak in the altered environment and, hence, maintain a viable population, or be maladaptive and move the population further from the peak and increase the risk of extinction. The radiation of the three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus from the ocean to different freshwater habitats has provided much information on adaptation to new environmental conditions. Currently, human-induced eutrophication is changing the breeding areas of these fish, which creates a model system for investigation of responses to rapid environmental disturbance. Results show that a primary reaction is plastic alterations of behaviour, with some adjustments being adaptive while others are not. At the same time, the strength of sexual selection on several traits is relaxed, which could increase the relative importance of survival selection. Whether this will restore population viability depends on the amount of standing genetic variation in the right direction. Human disturbances can be dramatic and resolution of the limit of flexibility and the possibility of genetic adaptation should be important targets of future research.},

abstract = {10.1073/pnas.0901639106 As the rate and magnitude of climate change accelerate, understanding the consequences becomes increasingly important. Species distribution models (SDMs) based on current ecological niche constraints are used to project future species distributions. These models contain assumptions that add to the uncertainty in model projections stemming from the structure of the models, the algorithms used to translate niche associations into distributional probabilities, the quality and quantity of data, and mismatches between the scales of modeling and data. We illustrate the application of SDMs using two climate models and two distributional algorithms, together with information on distributional shifts in vegetation types, to project fine-scale future distributions of 60 California landbird species. Most species are projected to decrease in distribution by 2070. Changes in total species richness vary over the state, with large losses of species in some “hotspots” of vulnerability. Differences in distributional shifts among species will change species co-occurrences, creating spatial variation in similarities between current and future assemblages. We use these analyses to consider how assumptions can be addressed and uncertainties reduced. SDMs can provide a useful way to incorporate future conditions into conservation and management practices and decisions, but the uncertainties of model projections must be balanced with the risks of taking the wrong actions or the costs of inaction. Doing this will require that the sources and magnitudes of uncertainty are documented, and that conservationists and resource managers be willing to act despite the uncertainties. The alternative, of ignoring the future, is not an option.},

abstract = {Interactions among competition, predation, and disturbance in determining the abundances of four species of anurans were studied in a factorial experiment using 36 replicated experimental ponds. Hatchlings of the four species (Rana utricularia, Scaphiopus holbrooki, Bufo americanus, and Hyla chrysoscelis) were introduced at the same relative abundances at a low or a high initial density. Competition determined survival, body size at metamorphosis, and length of larval period in high-density communities, which were food-limited. The predatory salamander Notophthalmus viridescens did not alter either the total number of metamorphs or their combined biomass in the high-density communities, but the relative abundance of metamorphs was shifted as Scaphiopus holbrooki, the competitive dominant, was selectively eaten. In low-density communities, predation decreased survival and biomass production of tadpoles, often to zero, in all species. For each of the four combinations of tadpole density and presence or absence of predators, ponds were drained at three rates to simulate different drying regimes. Competition slowed growth and thus increased the risk of desiccation in high-density populations in drying ponds. Predation ameliorated the effects of competition, allowing survivors to grow rapidly enough to metamorphose before ponds dried. Survival of tadpoles to metamorphosis, body size at metamorphosis, and the timing of metamorphosis were determined in a complex way by interactions among all of the treatment effects and the life history characteristics of the four species studied. Scaphiopus was the species least sensitive to tadpole density and was the competitive dominant in ponds without newts. It has a rapid growth rate and metamorphosed soon enough to escape desiccation. It suffered the greatest risk of predation and was eliminated from even some of the high-density communities. Rana was most successful in low-density communities without predators. No Rana survived in rapidly drying (50-d) ponds because of insufficient time to obtain a minimum size for metamorphosis. Rana were also eliminated from most populations exposed to predation. The effect of competition on Bufo in high-density populations, few or no survivors, was reversed by predation as newts selectively fed on Scaphiopus and Rana. This result was most striking in the tanks that dried most rapidly. Hyla did very poorly in all slowly drying (1 OO-d) tanks compared with controls because of intense competition. It had moderate success in high-density communities where newts had removed most competitors. These results show that biological and environmental factors interact to determine the structure of anuran communities. Neither competition nor predation is the single unifying force, but rather they interact to determine the different consequences of the date of drying of a pond to the success of each species.},

abstract = {Glaciers harbour diverse microorganisms, which upon ice melt can be released downstream. In glacier-fed streams microorganisms can attach to stones or sediments to form benthic biofilms. We used 454-pyrosequencing to explore the bulk (16S rDNA) and putatively active (16S rRNA) microbial communities of stone and sediment biofilms across 26 glacier-fed streams. We found differences in community composition between bulk and active communities among streams and a stronger congruence between biofilm types. Relative abundances of rRNA and rDNA were positively correlated across different taxa and taxonomic levels, but at lower taxonomic levels, the higher abundance in either the active or the bulk communities became more apparent. Here, environmental variables played a minor role in structuring active communities. However, we found a large number of rare taxa with higher relative abundances in rRNA compared with rDNA. This suggests that rare taxa contribute disproportionately to microbial community dynamics in glacier-fed streams. Our findings propose that high community turnover, where taxa repeatedly enter and leave the 'seed bank', contributes to the maintenance of microbial biodiversity in harsh ecosystems with continuous environmental perturbations, such as glacier-fed streams.},

abstract = {Recent advances in our understanding of the importance of continental- to global-scale connectivity among terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems make consideration of aquatic–terrestrial linkages an urgent ecological and environmental issue. Here, we describe the role of inland waters as sentinels and integrators of the impact of humans on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The metabolic responses of lakes and streams (ie the rates at which these systems process carbon) are proposed as a common metric to integrate the impacts of environ- mental change across a broad range of landscapes. Lakes and streams transport and alter nutrients, contami- nants, and energy, and store signals of environmental change from local to continental scales over periods ranging from weeks to millennia. A carefully conceived and well-integrated network that includes monitoring and experimental approaches to terrestrial–aquatic connectivity is critical to an understanding of basic ecosys- tem-level processes and to forecasting and mitigating future environmental impacts at the continental scale.},

abstract = {We present the results of a fullyear of high-resolution monitoring of hydrologic event-driven export of stream dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the forested BigelowBrook watershed in Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA. A combination of in situ fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) measurement, grab samples, and bioassays was utilized. FDOM was identified as a strong indicator of con- centration for dissolved organic carbon (DOC, r2 = 0.96), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON, r2 = 0.81), and bioavailable DOC (BDOC, r2 = 0.81). Relationships between FDOM and concentration were utilized to improve characterization of patterns of hydrological event-driven export and the quantification of annual export. This characterization was possible because DOM composition remained relatively consistent seasonally; however, a subtle shift to increased fluorescence per unit absorbance wasobservedfor summerandfall seasonsandpercent BDOC did increase slightly with increasing concentrations. The majority of export occurred during pulsed hydrological events, so the greatest impact of bioavailable exports may be on downstream aquatic ecosystems.Export fromindividual eventswashighly seasonal in nature with the highest flow weighted mean concentrations (DOCFW) being observed in late summer and fall months, but the highest total export being observed for larger winter storms. Seasonal trends in DOC export coincide with weather driven changes in surface and subsurface flow paths, potential for depletion and rebuilding of a flushable soil organic matter pool, and the availability of terrestrial carbon sources such as leaf litter. Our approach and findings demonstrate the utility ofhigh frequency FDOM measurement to improve estimates of intra-annual temporal trends of DOM export.},

abstract = {Abstract Background: Twelve distinct explanations have been proposed for the co-existence of species in ecological communities. Types of mechanism: The mechanisms can be divided into those that are stabilizing, i.e. with an increase-when-rare mechanism, and those that are equalizing, the latter on their own only delaying the exclusion of species. However, by evening out fitness, equalizing mechanisms can facilitate the operation of stabilizing mechanisms. Importance: It is suggested that circular interference networks, co-evolution of similar interference ability, cyclic succession, equal chance (neutrality) and initial patch composition are likely to be unimportant, or perhaps not even occur. Equal chance is an equalizing mechanism. Allogenic disturbance, alpha-niche differentiation, environmental fluctuation (relative non-linearity and/or the storage effect) and pest pressure are probably important. All four are stabilizing. More evidence is needed on aggregation, interference/dispersal trade-offs and the spatial mass effect. Aggregation and the spatial mass effect are equalizing. Suggestions are made of the evidence needed to make informed judgements on which contribute the most to co-existence in plant communities.},

abstract = {Two competing consumer species may coexist using a single homogeneous resource when the more efficient consumer--the one having the lowest equilibrium resource density--has a more nonlinear functional response that generates consumer-resource cycles. We extend this model of nonequilibrium coexistence, as proposed by Armstrong and McGehee, by putting the interaction into a spatial context using two frameworks: a spatially explicit individual-based model and a spatially implicit metapopulation model. We find that Armstrong and McGehee's mechanism of coexistence can operate in a spatial context. However, individual-based simulations suggest that decreased dispersal restricts coexistence in most cases, whereas differential equation models of metapopulations suggest that a low rate of dispersal between subpopulations often increases the coexistence region. This difference arises in part because of two potentially opposing effects on coexistence due to the asynchrony in the temporal dynamics at different locations. Asynchrony implies that the less efficient species is more likely to be favored in some spatial locations at any given time, which broadens the conditions for coexistence. On the other hand, asynchrony and dispersal can also reduce the amplitude of local population cycles, which restricts coexistence. The relative influence of these two effects depends on details of the population dynamics and the representation of space. Our results also demonstrate that coexistence via the Armstrong-McGehee mechanism can occur even when there is little variation in the global densities of either the consumers or the resource, suggesting that empirical studies of the mechanisms should measure densities on several spatial scales.},

@article{Winegardner2012,
abstract = {One of the most promising theoretical frameworks for studying responses to ecological change is the metacommunity concept. Recent work by Logue et al. [1] provided the first comprehensive synthesis of empirical metacommunity research since the seminal work by Leibold et al. published in 2004 [2]. In their original work [2], Leibold et al. outlined the theoretical framework for the study of a metacommunity, a set of local communities connected by dispersing species. Logue et al.[1] point out some of the limitations of the original concept as well as more recent research. More importantly, they make three recommendations for future research in metacommunity ecology to continue to advance this field: (i) the extension of empirical approaches to different and varied metacommunity systems; (ii) the integration of established metacommunity paradigms; and (iii) work incorporating meta-ecosystem and evolutionary mechanisms. These are important recommendations, but we think that their second recommendation is a necessary condition for the other two. We propose that a revision of the terminology used by Leibold et al. [2] can already accomplish part of this integration. Leibold et al.[2] proposed four paradigms of metacommunities: (i) neutral model; (ii) patch dynamics; (iii) mass effects; and (iv) species sorting, synthesizing concepts of intra- and intercommunity dynamics [2]. These four paradigms have formed the basis for the modern metacommunity concept, and much literature has characterized metacommunities based on the degree to which the systems conform to these paradigms (e.g. [2]). What the terminology of Leibold et al.[2] does not explicitly recognize is that two of these metacommunity paradigms (mass effects and patch dynamics) are actually special cases of the species-sorting paradigm. In the patch dynamics paradigm, the interacting species differ from each other, but in a very specific way. They specialize in their abilities as either competitors or colonizers within a uniform environment. Patches of varying species composition develop as species effectively colonize a site or outcompete other species. A second, less described, type of patch dynamics starts from a species-sorting setting, with environmental heterogeneity and associated species differences. Strong priority effects in such a system caused by dispersal limitation can lead to different and stable communities [3]. For the mass effects paradigm, source-sink dynamics enable species to exist at sites normally considered marginal or outside of their environmental range because high dispersal ensures a constant supply of new colonizers to these sites [2]. Therefore, these species have very different niche requirements, essentially a species-sorting framework, but dispersal maintains species in sites with negative growth rates. The only way to detect mass effects truly is to model or measure population growth rates of a species in an environment with and without dispersal. Thus, the distinguishing feature of a patch dynamic versus a species-sorting versus a mass effect framework is the amount of dispersal present between communities within a metacommunity: dispersal is limiting for some of the species in the patch dynamic framework, efficient for (the majority of) the species in a species-sorting framework, and high for some of the species in the mass effect framework. The terminology used by Leibold et al.[2] ensures consistency with the previous concepts in the literature. For example, terms such as 'patch dynamics' or 'mass effects' were already well documented in the literature before this work (e.g. [3], [4], [5], [6] and [7]). Although we doubt that it was the intention of Leibold et al. [2] to suggest that these four paradigms were mutually exclusive or that each metacommunity system was uniquely associated with a single paradigm, the summary of research provided by Logue et al. [1] shows that work since 2004 has largely focused on delineating between the four paradigms (e.g. [8]). Indeed, Logue et al. [1] showed that the majority of observational metacommunity studies were aimed at testing for patch dynamics or mass effects. Thus, the terminology of the four paradigms ensures consistency over time, but continuing to use these terms while not explicitly recognizing, for instance, that patch dynamics and mass effects are special cases of the species-sorting paradigm does not address the actual relationships between the different paradigms. More importantly, these relationships illustrate the fundamental mechanistic processes responsible for metacommunities. We suggest that ecologists could move on from characterizing metacommunities as 'species sorting', 'patch dynamics', 'mass effects' or 'neutral model'. Rather, they should break these paradigms down and go back to the basics of thinking about what these paradigms mean for dispersal and environmental signals in metacommunities. This avoids the issue of having four discrete paradigms, and rather puts the focus on the relationships at play in metacommunities and how the mechanisms behind the patterns that describe each of the paradigms interact in a metacommunity. We thus propose to think about metacommunities as neutral, and species sorting with limiting (patch dynamics, sensu [2]), efficient (species sorting, sensu [2]), and high dispersal (mass effects, sensu [2]) as these terms capture the causal mechanisms and are, thus, more explicit.},

abstract = {We reviewed concepts of patch dynamics and environmental heterogeneity and their applications to the study of fluvial ecosystems, with emphasis on research published in J-NABS. We discuss several important papers synthesizing theories and findings on this topic and reports of descriptive and experimental research. A large body of research, much of it published in J-NABS, has demonstrated how spatial and temporal variation influences population, community, and ecosystem patterns and processes in fluvial ecosystems. Conceptual models of patch dynamics can be traced to 2 basic approaches: 1) the landscape ecology perspective and 2) the metacommunity perspective. The former focuses on how spatial patterns are created and affect ecological processes over variable scales of space and time, whereas the latter emphasizes the important influence of periodic disturbances, refugia, and dispersal in maintaining nonequilibrium communities within patchmosaics. The origin of themetacommunity PatchDynamics Concept can be traced to G. EvelynHutchinson's ideas about nonequilibriumcommunities, and a key contribution was Townsend's (19894) J-NABS review of the Patch Dynamics Concept in stream community ecology. The studyof fluvial ecosystem ecology from a patch-dynamics landscape perspective is well represented by empirical studies published in J-NABS, but some emerging topics remain little studied, including: 1) experiments designed to test predictions of the Patch Dynamics Concept of metacommunities vs alternative models; 2) empirical documentation of patch dynamics and their effects on ecological processes across longitudinal, lateral, and temporal gradients; 3) the influence of species' life-history attributes on community dynamics in relation to habitat characteristics and aspects of disturbance; and 4) the manner in which landscape patterns, patch dynamics, and metacommunity dynamics affect foodweb patterns and processes.},

abstract = {A revolution is occurring in biology: perhaps it is better characterized as a revolution within a revolution. I am, of course, referring to the impact that the increasingly rapid capacity to sequence nucleic acids is having on a science that has already been radically transformed by molecular ap- proaches and concepts. While the impact is currently great- est in genetics and applied areas such as medicine and biotechnology, its most profound and lasting effect will be on our perception of evolution and its relationship to the rest of biology. The cell is basically an historical document, and gaining the capacity to read it (by the sequencing of genes) cannot but drastically alter the way we look at all of biology. No discipline within biology will be more changed by this revolution than microbiology, for until the advent of molec- ular sequencing, bacterial evolution was not a subject that could be approached experimentally. With any novel scientific departure it is important to understand the historical setting in which it arises-the paradigm it will change. Old prejudices tend to inhibit, distort, or otherwise shape new ideas, and historical analysis helps to eliminate much of the negative impact of the status quo. Stch analysis is particularly importaht in the present instance since microbiologists do not deal with evolutionary considerations as a matter of course and so tend not to appreciate them. Therefore, I begin this discussion with a brief look at how the relationship between microbiology and evolution (i.e., the lack thereof) developed.},

abstract = {We investigated the influence of flood-induced channel changes on the hyporheic zone of 4th- and 5th-order reaches of a mountain stream network. Preflood versus postflood comparisons were made in three study reaches from well networks established before and reestablished after a major flood. Flood effects were scale dependent and varied with channel constraint and the dominant channel forming process. Large changes were observed in unconstrained stream reaches where channel incision drove large changes in subsurface flow paths and the extent of the hyporheic zone. However, subreach scale differences were apparent. In the lower portion of the studied reach, channel incision lowered the water table, leading to abandonment of secondary channels, and decreased the extent of the hyporheic zone that previously extended more than 30 m into the floodplain. In contrast, the extent of the hyporheic zone increased at the head of the studied reach where channel incision steepened head gradients through a meander bend. In another unconstrained reach, lateral channel jumps dramatically altered exchange flow paths. However, the extensive hyporheic zone was maintained throughout the reach. Less change was observed in the constrained stream reach where both the depth and area of sediment available to be reworked by the flood were limited by bedrock constraining the width of the valley floor. This flood dramatically changed the hyporheic zone at the three study sites and these physical changes are expected to be biologically important, considering the role of the hyporheic zone in stream ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Americans spend the vast majority of their lives in built environments. Even traditionally outdoor pursuits, such as exercising, are often now performed indoors. Bacteria that colonize these indoor ecosystems are primarily derived from the human microbiome. The modes of human interaction with indoor surfaces and the physical conditions associated with each surface type determine the steady-state ecology of the microbial community.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Bacterial assemblages associated with different surfaces in three athletic facilities, including floors, mats, benches, free weights, and elliptical handles, were sampled every other hour (8 am to 6 pm) for 2 days. Surface and equipment type had a stronger influence on bacterial community composition than the facility in which they were housed. Surfaces that were primarily in contact with human skin exhibited highly dynamic bacterial community composition and non-random co-occurrence patterns, suggesting that different host microbiomes-shaped by selective forces-were being deposited on these surfaces through time. However, bacterial assemblages found on the floors and mats changed less over time, and species co-occurrence patterns appeared random, suggesting more neutral community assembly.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These longitudinal patterns highlight the dramatic turnover of microbial communities on surfaces in regular contact with human skin. By uncovering these longitudinal patterns, this study promotes a better understanding of microbe-human interactions within the built environment.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of microbial taxa is determined primarily by physical and chemical environments and by dispersal. In a homogeneous landscape with limited dispersal, the similarity in abundance of taxa in samples declines with separation distance. We present a one-dimensional model for the spatial autocorrelation in abundances arising from immigration from some remote community and dispersal between environmentally similar landscape patches. Spatial correlation in taxa abundances were calculated from biofilms from the beds of two flumes which differed only in their bedform profiles; one flat and the other a periodic sawtooth shape. The hydraulic regime is approximately uniform over the flat bed, whereas the sawtooth induces fast flow over the peaks and recirculation in the troughs. On the flat bed, the correlation decline between samples was reproduced by a model using one biologically reasonable parameter. A decline was apparent in the other flume; however, a better fit was achieved when dispersal was not assumed constant everywhere. However, analysis of finer-resolution data for the heterogeneous flume suggested even this model did not adequately capture the community's complexity. We conclude that hydrodynamics are a strong driver of taxa-abundance patterns in stream biofilms. However, local adaptability must also be considered to build up a complete mechanistic model.},

abstract = {The recent observation of a power-law relationship, S proportional A(z), between number of taxa, S, and area, A, for microbial eukaryotes and bacteria suggests that this is one of the few generic relationships in ecology, applicable to plants, animals and microbes. However, the rate of increase in the number of species with area varies from approximately the fourth (z = 0.26) to as little as the 50th root (z = 0.0019) in microbes. This is an enormous range for which no quantitative explanation has been proffered. We show by sampling from synthetic populations that the disparity between sample and community sizes in microbial community surveys means z can be considerably underestimated and accrual of rare taxa with increasing area will not be detectable. Significant microbial taxa-area relationships will only be observed when changes in community structure within samples correlate with area. Thus, the very low z values observed recently cannot be used as the sole evidence in support of any particular community theory of community assembly. More generally, this suggests that our search for patterns and laws in the microbial world will be profoundly influenced and, potentially distorted by the sample sizes that are typical of microbial community surveys.},

abstract = {1. Most research on freshwater (and other) food webs has focused on apparently discrete communities, in well-defined habitats at small spatial and temporal scales, whereas in reality food webs are embedded in complex landscapes, such as river corridors. Food web linkages across such landscapes may be crucial for ecological pattern and process, however. Here, we consider the importance of large scale influences upon lotic food webs across the three spatial dimensions and through time. 2. We assess the roles of biotic factors (e.g. predation, competition) and physical habitat features (e.g. geology, land-use, habitat fragmentation) in moulding food web structure at the landscape scale. As examples, external subsidies to lotic communities of nutrients, detritus and prey vary along the river corridor, and food web links are made and broken across the land-water interface with the rise and fall of the flood. 3. We identify several avenues of potentially fruitful research, particularly the need to quantify energy flow and population dynamics. Stoichiometric analysis of changes in C : N : P nutrient ratios over large spatial gradients (e.g. from river source to mouth, in forested versus agricultural catchments), offers a novel method of uniting energy flow and population dynamics to provide a more holistic view of riverine food webs from a landscape perspective. Macroecological approaches can be used to examine large-scale patterns in riverine food webs (e.g. trophic rank and species-area relationships). New multivariate statistical techniques can be used to examine community responses to environmental gradients and to assign traits to individual species (e.g. body-size, functional feeding group), to unravel the organisation and trophic structure of riverine food webs.},

abstract = {We present a broad comparative assessment of nested subsets in species composition among ecological communities. We assembled presence-absence data from a broad range of taxa, geographic regions, and spatial scales; and subjected this collection of datasets to common analyses, including a variety of metrics for measuring nestedness and null hypotheses against which to evaluate them. Here we identify ecological patterns in the prevalence and strength of nested subset structure, and assess differences and biases among the available methodologies. In all, we compiled 279 presence-absence matrices, of which 163 do not overlap in their coverage of species and sites. The survey includes studies on vertebrates, arthropods, mollusks, plants, and other taxa; from north temperate, tropical, and south temperate latitudes. Our results were as follows. Statistically significant nestedness was common. Assemblages from landbridge archipelagos were strongly nested, and immigration experiments were least nested. This adds further empirical support to the hypothesis that extinction plays a major role in producing nested structure. Nestedness was positively correlated with the ratio of the areas of the largest and smallest sites, suggesting that the range in area of sites affects nestedness. Taxonomic differences in nestedness were weak. Higher taxonomic levels showed stronger nesting than their constituent lower taxa. We observed no effect of distance of isolation on nestedness; nor any effects of latitude. With regard to methodology, the metrics Nc and Ut yielded similar results, although Nc proved slightly more flexible in use, and deals differently with tied sites. Similarities also exist in the behavior of NO ('N') and Up, and between N1 and Ua. Standardized nestedness metrics were mostly insensitive to matrix size, and were useful in comparative analyses among presence-absence matrices. Most metrics were affected by the proportion of presences in the matrix. All analyses of nestedness, therefore, should test for bias due to matrix fill. We suggest that the factors controlling nested subset structure can be thought of as four filters that species pass to occur at a site: a sampling filter, a distance filter, a habitat filter, and an area filter - and three constraints on community homogeneity: evolutionary history, recent history, and spatial variation in the environment. The scale of examination can also have important effects on the degree of nestedness observed.},

abstract = {Landscapes are hierarchical mosaics of patches that differ in their age, size, shape, content, and other aspects. The Jasper Ridge serpentine grassland exemplifies hierarchical patchiness and pattern—process interactions that are common features of natural ecosystems. Gopher mounds formed each year destroy all the plant individuals underneath and result in conspicuous spatial pattern in the landscape. A snapshot of the system is, therefore, a reflection of the patch mosaic of gopher mounds that are different in age and species composition and abundance. Based on a patch dynamics perspective, we have developed a spatially explicit patch—based modeling approach to studying landscape pattern and process dynamics. The simulation model (PatchMod) has two major components: a spatially explicit, age— and size—structured patch demographic model and a multiple—species plant population dynamic model. We use this simulation model to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of the disturbance patches and of populations of two species on the local and landscape scales. The spatial patch dynamic model can relate spatiotemporal dynamics of plant populations to the age— and size—structured disturbance patch population, taking into account variability in microhabitats, complexity in patch overlap, and patch—based plant competition. The localized gopher disturbances can significantly structure the vegetation dynamics at the landscape level. Local populations at the patch level may go extinct frequently, though metapopulations may show little fluctuation. Disturbance promotes coexistence of Bromus mollis and Lasthenia californica by divorcing local competitive exclusion and global extinction. The functional representation of an ecological relationship such as density—dependent fecundity at the local patch scale may be transmuted by patchiness at the landscape scale.},

abstract = {Biofilms, in which cells attach to surfaces and secrete slime (polymeric substances), are central to microbial life. Biofilms are often thought to require high levels of cooperation because extracellular polymeric substances are a shared resource produced by one cell that can be used by others. Here we examine this hypothesis by using a detailed individual-based simulation of a biofilm to investigate the outcome of evolutionary competitions between strains that differ in their level of polymer production. Our model includes a biochemical description of the carbon fluxes for growth and polymer production, and it explicitly calculates diffusion-reaction effects and the resulting solute gradients in the biofilm. An emergent property of these simple but realistic mechanistic assumptions is a strong evolutionary advantage to extracellular polymer production. Polymer secretion is altruistic to cells above a focal cell: it pushes later generations in their lineage up and out into better oxygen conditions, but it harms others; polymer production suffocates neighboring nonpolymer producers. This property, analogous to vertical growth in plants, suggests that polymer secretion provides a strong competitive advantage to cell lineages within mixed-genotype biofilms: global cooperation is not required. Our model fundamentally changes how biofilms are expected to respond to changing social conditions; the presence of multiple strains in a biofilm should promote rather than inhibit polymer secretion.},

abstract = {In response to the scarcity of tools to make quantitative forecasts of the loss of aquatic species from anthropogenic effects, we present a statistical model that relates fish species richness to river discharge. Fish richness increases logarithmically with discharge, an index of habitat space, similar to a species-area curve in terrestrial systems. We apply the species-discharge model as a forecasting tool to build scenarios of changes in riverine fish richness from climate change, water consumption, and other anthropogenic drivers that reduce river discharge. Using hypothetical reductions in discharges (of magnitudes that have been observed in other rivers), we predict that reductions of 20-90{\%} in discharge would result in losses of 2-38{\%} of the fish species in two biogeographical regions in the United States (Lower Ohio-Upper Mississippi and Southeastern). Additional data on the occurrence of specific species relative to specific discharge regimes suggests that fishes found exclusively in high discharge environments (e.g., Shovelnose sturgeon) would be most vulnerable to reductions in discharge. Lag times in species extinctions after discharge reduction provide a window of opportunity for conservation efforts. Applications of the species-discharge model can help prioritize such management efforts among species and rivers.},

abstract = {Although the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning has become a major focus in ecology, its significance in a fluctuating environment is still poorly understood. According to the insurance hypothesis, biodiversity insures ecosystems against declines in their functioning because many species provide greater guarantees that some will maintain functioning even if others fail. Here we examine this hypothesis theoretically. We develop a general stochastic dynamic model to assess the effects of species richness on the expected temporal mean and variance of ecosystem processes such as productivity, based on individual species' productivity responses to environmental fluctuations. Our model shows two major insurance effects of species richness on ecosystem productivity: (i) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance of productivity, and (ii) a performance-enhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean of productivity. The strength of these insurance effects is determined by three factors: (i) the way ecosystem productivity is determined by individual species responses to environmental fluctuations, (ii) the degree of asynchronicity of these responses, and (iii) the detailed form of these responses. In particular, the greater the variance of the species responses, the lower the species richness at which the temporal mean of the ecosystem process saturates and the ecosystem becomes redundant. These results provide a strong theoretical foundation for the insurance hypothesis, which proves to be a fundamental principle for understanding the long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {Abstract Ecologists have increasingly focused on how rapid adaptive trait changes can affect population dynamics. Rapid adaptation can result from either rapid evolution or phenotypic plasticity, but their effects on population dynamics are seldom compared directly. Here we examine theoretically the effects of rapid evolution and phenotypic plasticity of antipredatory defense on predator-prey dynamics. Our analyses reveal that phenotypic plasticity tends to stabilize population dynamics more strongly than rapid evolution. It is therefore important to know the mechanism by which phenotypic variation is generated for predicting the dynamics of rapidly adapting populations. We next examine an advantage of a phenotypically plastic prey genotype over the polymorphism of specialist prey genotypes. Numerical analyses reveal that the plastic genotype, if there is a small cost for maintaining it, cannot coexist with the pairs of specialist counterparts unless the system has a limit cycle. Furthermore, for the plastic genotype to replace specialist genotypes, a forced environmental fluctuation is critical in a broad parameter range. When these results are combined, the plastic genotype enjoys an advantage with population oscillations, but plasticity tends to lose its advantage by stabilizing the oscillations. This dilemma leads to an interesting intermittent limit cycle with the changing frequency of phenotypic plasticity.},

abstract = {The population dynamics of a one-predator-two-prey system were modeled. This model included the evolution of antipredator defense in the prey species and the optimal diet choice in the predator and was analyzed numerically using computer simulations. Results showed that defense evolution in the prey species tended to promote coexistence of the three species and, depending on parameters, reduced the amplitude of density fluctuations. Introducing optimal diet choice by the predator into the model also promoted coexistence and generally reduced density fluctuations. When the additive genetic variance for defense intensity was large (i.e., the evolutionary rate of defense was rapid), coexistence of the three species and stabilization of dynamics tended to be promoted. As a consequence, we concluded that (1) the evolution of antipredator defense can be an important factor in the persistence of a community, either with or without the optimal diet choice of predator; and (2) when population dynamics are combined with the evolutionary dynamics of trait development, the relative time scale of the two processes plays an important role in the stability of the system.},

Soils from replicated plots of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and red alder (Alnus rubra) were characterized using fungal ITS (internal transcribed spacer region), eubacterial 16S rRNA, and archaeal 16S rRNA primers. Population size was measured with quantitative (Q)-PCR and composition was examined using length heterogeneity (LH)-PCR for fungal composition, terminal restriction fragment length (T-RFLP) profiles for bacterial and archaeal composition, and sequencing to identify dominant community members. Whereas fungal and archaeal composition varied between sites and dominant tree species, bacterial communities only varied between sites. The abundance of archaeal gene copy numbers was found to be greater in coastal compared to montane soils accounting for 11{\%} of the prokaryotic community. Crenarchaea groups 1.1a-associated, 1.1b, 1.1c, and 1.1c-associated were putatively identified. A greater abundance of Crenarchaea 1.1b indicator fragments was found in acidic (pH 4) soils with low C:N ratios under red alder. In coastal soils, 25{\%} of fungal sequences were putatively identified as basidiomycetous yeasts belonging to the genus Cryptococcus. Although the function of these yeasts in soil is not known, they could significantly contribute to decomposition processes in coastal soils distinguished by rapid tree growth, high N content, low pH, and frequent water-saturation events.},

abstract = {One explanation given for the high microbial diversity found in soils is that they contain a large inactive biomass that is able to persist in soils for long periods of time. This persistent microbial fraction may help to buffer the functionality of the soil community during times of low nutrients by providing a reservoir of specialized functions that can be reactivated when conditions improve. A study was designed to test the hypothesis: in soils lacking fresh root or detrital inputs, microbial community composition may persist relatively unchanged. Upon addition of new inputs, this community will be stimulated to grow and break down litter similarly to control soils. Soils from two of the Detrital Input and Removal Treatments (DIRT) at the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, the no-input and control treatment plots, were used in a microcosm experiment where Douglas-fir needles were added to soils. After 3 and 151 days of incubation, soil microbial DNA and RNA was extracted and characterized using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and 454 pyrosequencing. The abundance of 16S and 28S gene copies and RNA copies did not vary with soil type or amendment; however, treatment differences were observed in the abundance of archaeal ammonia-oxidizing amoA gene abundance. Analysis of approximately 110,000 bacterial sequences showed a significant change in the active (RNA-based) community between day 3 and day 151, but microbial composition was similar between soil types. These results show that even after 12 years of plant litter exclusion, the legacy of community composition was well buffered against a dramatic disturbance.},

abstract = {Coexistence mechanisms of two co-occurring species of Proteaceae, Protea lepidocarpodendron and Leucospermum conocarpodendron, were studied. Both are tall, arborescent shrubs forming the overstory of the fynbos communities in which they occur. Seeds of L. conocarpodendron are dispersed by ants while those of P. lepidocarpodendron are dispersed by wind. The seedlings compete for space made available after periodic fires. Seedlings of the ant-dispersed species are scarce under the skeletons of the wind-dispersed species after a fire but relatively common in open sites. In contrast, seedlings of the wind-dispersed species are densest under their own skeletons and rare in open sites. Seedlings of the ant-dispersed species are outgrown by their wind-dispersed competitors and suffer reduced fecundity and increased mortality when they co-occur. The adult survival of the ant-dispersed species in light fires is also reduced when it establishes under or next to the wind- dispersed species. A Markovian model of the system suggests that ant dispersal of Leucospermum seed reduces the rate of competitive exclusion by Protea but is not sufficient to explain the persistence of the former in this system. To persist, Leucospermum requires open space, which is made available either by adult survival in light fires which set back its Protea competitor or by survival as seed banks through burns that destroy the seed banks of Protea.},

abstract = {Spatial variation of communities composition (metacommunities) results from multiple assembly mechanisms, including environmental filtering and dispersal; however, whether and why the relative importance of the assembly mechanisms in shaping bacterial metacommunity changes through time in marine pelagic systems remains poorly studied. Here, we applied the elements of metacommunity structure framework and the variation partitioning framework to examine whether temporal variation of hydrographic conditions influences bacterioplankton metacommunity dynamics in the southern East China Sea (ECS). The spatiotemporal variation of bacterial communities composition was revealed using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA. In addition to the whole bacterial community, we analyzed four dominant taxonomic groups (Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria) separately. Our analyses indicate that, considering the whole community level, the determinism of metacommunity structure varied among seasons. When the degree of connectivity was low (December), the metacommunity exhibited random distribution and was explained mainly by the environmental component. However, Clementsian metacommunity was found at intermediate connectivity (May), during which the environmental and spatial predictors were both significant. When connectivity was high (August), a random distribution pattern was found and no significant effect of environmental filtering or dispersal limitation was detected. Nevertheless, when considering different taxonomic groups, the differences in metacommunity dynamics among groups were found. Our results suggest that the driving forces of metacommunity dynamics varied depending on hydrography, as the degrees of environmental heterogeneity and connectivity among habitat patches were determined by circulation pattern. Moreover, mechanisms varied among different taxonomic groups, suggesting that differential dispersal capacity among taxonomic groups should be integrated into community assembly studies.},

Grazed algae were better defended, yielding rotifer growth rate 32{\%} below that of animals fed non-grazed algae, but they also had diminished competitive ability, with a growth rate under nutrient-limiting conditions 28{\%} below that of non-grazed algae. Grazed algae also had a smaller cell size and were more concentrated in carbon and nitrogen. Thus, C. vulgaris genotypes vary phenotypically in their position along a trade-off curve between defence against grazing and competitive ability. This genetic variation underlies rapid algal evolution that significantly alters the ecological predator-prey cycles between rotifers and algae.},

abstract = {Ecological and evolutionary dynamics can occur on similar timescales. However, theoretical predictions of how rapid evolution can affect ecological dynamics are inconclusive and often depend on untested model assumptions. Here we report that rapid prey evolution in response to oscillating predator density affects predator-prey (rotifer-algal) cycles in laboratory microcosms. Our experiments tested explicit predictions from a model for our system that allows prey evolution. We verified the predicted existence of an evolutionary tradeoff between algal competitive ability and defence against consumption, and examined its effects on cycle dynamics by manipulating the evolutionary potential of the prey population. Single-clone algal cultures (lacking genetic variability) produced short cycle periods and typical quarter-period phase lags between prey and predator densities, whereas multi-clonal (genetically variable) algal cultures produced long cycles with prey and predator densities nearly out of phase, exactly as predicted. These results confirm that prey evolution can substantially alter predator-prey dynamics, and therefore that attempts to understand population oscillations in nature cannot neglect potential effects from ongoing rapid evolution.},

Hyporheic zones can have high denitrification potentials, but their role in reach- and network-scale NO3- removal is unknown because it is difficult to estimate. We used independent and complementary multiscale measurements of denitrification and total NO3- uptake to quantify the role of hyporheic NO3- removal in a 303-m reach of a 3(rd)-order agricultural stream in western Oregon, USA. We characterized the reach-scale NO3- dynamics with steady-state N-15-NO3- tracer-addition experiments and solute-transport modeling, and measured the hyporheic conditions via in-situ biogeochemical and groundwater modeling. We also developed a method to link these independent multiscale measurements. Hyporheic NO3- removal (rate coefficient (HZ) = 0.007/h) accounted for 17{\%} of the observed total reach NO3- uptake and 32{\%} of the reach denitrification estimated from the N-15 experiments. The primary limitations on hyporheic denitrification at the reach scale were availability of labile dissolved organic C and the restricted size of the hyporheic zone caused by anthropogenic channelization (sediment thickness 1.5 m). Linking multiscale methods made estimates possible for hyporheic influence on stream NO3- dynamics. However, it also demonstrated that the traditional reach-scale tracer experimental designs and subsequent transport modeling cannot be used alone to directly investigate the role of the hyporheic zone on reach-scale water and solute dynamics.},

abstract = {The importance of microbial activity to ecosystem function in aquatic ecosystems is well established, but microbial diversity has been less frequently addressed. This review and synthesis of 100s of published studies on stream microbial diversity shows that factors known to drive ecosystem processes, such as nutrient availability, hydrology, metal contamination, contrasting land-use and temperature, also cause heterogeneity in bacterial diversity. Temporal heterogeneity in stream bacterial diversity was frequently observed, reflecting the dynamic nature of both stream ecosystems and microbial community composition. However, within-stream spatial differences in stream bacterial diversity were more commonly observed, driven specifically by different organic matter (OM) compartments. Bacterial phyla showed similar patterns in relative abundance with regard to compartment type across different streams. For example, surface water contained the highest relative abundance of Actinobacteria, while epilithon contained the highest relative abundance of Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes. This suggests that contrasting physical and/or nutritional habitats characterized by different stream OM compartment types may select for certain bacterial lineages. When comparing the prevalence of physicochemical effects on stream bacterial diversity, effects of changing metal concentrations were most, while effects of differences in nutrient concentrations were least frequently observed. This may indicate that although changing nutrient concentrations do tend to affect microbial diversity, other environmental factors are more likely to alter stream microbial diversity and function. The common observation of connections between ecosystem process drivers and microbial diversity suggests that microbial taxonomic turnover could mediate ecosystem-scale responses to changing environmental conditions, including both microbial habitat distribution and physicochemical factors.},

abstract = {The classical, ecological, paradox of enrichment describes a phenomenon that resource enrichment destabilizes predator-prey systems by exacerbating population oscillations. Here we suggest a new, evolutionary, paradox of enrichment. Resource enrichment can lead to more asymmetrical predator-prey coevolution (i.e. extremely high levels of prey defenses against predators) that decreases predator abundances and increases predator extinction risk. A major reason for this is that high resource availability can reduce fitness costs associated with prey defenses. In our experiments with a bacterium and its lytic phage, nutrient-balanced resource enrichment led to patterns in population demography and coevolutionary dynamics consistent with this coevolution-based paradox of enrichment; in particular, phage population extinction events were observed under nutrient-rich, not nutrient-poor, conditions. Consistent with ecological studies, carbon-biased resource enrichment (with carbon availability disproportionately increased relative to other nutrients) did not destabilize dynamics, and the asymmetry of coevolution was not altered in this context. Our work highlights the importance of integrating ecological and evolutionary thinking for studies of the consequences of nutrient pollution and other types of environmental changes.

@article{Zinger2014,
abstract = {The taxa-area relationship (TAR) and the distance-decay relationship (DDR) both describe spatial turnover of taxa and are central patterns of biodiversity. Here, we compared TAR and DDR of bacterial communities across different marine realms and ecosystems at the global scale. To obtain reliable global estimates for both relationships, we quantified the poorly assessed effects of sequencing depth, rare taxa removal and number of sampling sites. Slope coefficients of bacterial TARs were within the range of those of plants and animals, whereas slope coefficients of bacterial DDR were much lower. Slope coefficients were mostly affected by removing rare taxa and by the number of sampling sites considered in the calculations. TAR and DDR slope coefficients were overestimated at sequencing depth {\textless}4000 sequences per sample. Noticeably, bacterial TAR and DDR patterns did not correlate with each other both within and across ecosystem types, suggesting that (i) TAR cannot be directly derived from DDR and (ii) TAR and DDR may be influenced by different ecological factors. Nevertheless, we found marine bacterial TAR and DDR to be steeper in ecosystems associated with high environmental heterogeneity or spatial isolation, namely marine sediments and coastal environments compared with pelagic ecosystems. Hence, our study provides information on macroecological patterns of marine bacteria, as well as methodological and conceptual insights, at a time when biodiversity surveys increasingly make use of high-throughput sequencing technologies.},

abstract = {Co-existence theories fail to adequately explain observed community patterns (diversity and composition) because theymainly address local extinctions. For a more complete understanding, the regional processes responsible for species for- mation and geographic dispersal should also be considered. The species pool concept holds that local variation in community patterns is dependent primarily on the availability of species,which is driven by historical diversification and dis- persal at continental and landscape scales. However, empirical evidence of his- torical effects is limited. This slow progress can be attributed to methodological difficulties in determining the characteristics of historical species pools and how they contributed to diversity patterns in contemporary landscapes. A role of landscape-scale dispersal limitation in determining local community patterns has been demonstrated by numerous seed addition experiments. However, dis- entangling general patterns of dispersal limitation in communities still requires attention. Distinguishing habitat-specific species pools can help to meet both applied and theoretical challenges. In conservation biology, the use of absolute richnessmay be uninformative because the size of species pools varies between habitats. For characterizing the dynamic state of individual communities, biodi- versity relative to species pools provides a balanced way of assessing communi- ties in different habitats. Information about species pools may also be useful when studying community assembly rules, because it enables a possiblemecha- nism of trait convergence (habitat filtering) to be explicitly assessed. Empirical study of the role of historic effects and dispersal on local community patterns has often been restricted due tomethodological difficulties in determining habi- tat-specific species pools. However, accumulating distributional, ecological and phylogenetic information, as well as use of appropriate model systems (e.g. archipelagos with known biogeographic histories) will allow the species pool concept to be applied effectively in future research},
